# Deadbolt App

SPA built with Vue, with VUE CLI, Vuex, and Vue Router.

The app features a highly interactive JSON config creator, which allows creators to make their own modded levels.

Content is mainly handled with a markdown parser, my preferred way of taking notes while I work.

The site itself provides information on DCP and DECP. These are major updates to the video game [Deadbolt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394970/DEADBOLT/) and its level editor, written in [GML](https://docs.yoyogames.com/index.html?page=source%2Fdadiospice%2F002_reference%2Findex.html) and made by updating the game's source code directly.

## Thumb (promo.jpg)

Since [DECP 4.0.0](decp#MDCL400), you can upload a thumbnail inside your level ZIP. Prior to this, you could set custom thumbnails with [this method](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=33077.0).

They <span class="color-r">must be</span> square, and <span class="color-r">must be</span> named <span class="color-purple">promo.jpg</span>

Here's a demo at `268` x `268`. You can use larger images but the picture quality will be lower.

These are the wide images used in your workshop item's gallery. They are uploaded via Steam itself.

They should be `637` x `358`

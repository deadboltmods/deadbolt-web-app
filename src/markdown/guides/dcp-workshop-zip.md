Both DECP and the vanilla level editor allow you to publish a collection of levels as a ZIP file. In [DECP 4.0.0](decp#MDCL400), you can also use this feature to publish a level with a thumbnail.

When uploading a ZIP file, your ZIP should contain the level and <span class="color-purple">promo.jpg</span> outside of any subfolders.

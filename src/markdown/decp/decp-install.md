## Installation

For more info on the different DECP builds see [Build Differences](#build-differences) below.

### Music

All music is replaced with silence to keep the ZIP size down and avoid unlicensed distribution. You can replace these silent OGG files in the editor folder with the ones from the base game.

Music will still play correctly when you load the level in the main game.

### Steam

Replaces the vanilla level editor:

1. Find the location of the level editor exe. It's near the main game folder, in `steamapps\common\Deadbolt Level Editor`
1. Backup the vanilla editor by renaming it to `deadbolt_map_editor.vanilla.exe`
1. Extract the contents of the zip to the level editor folder

You can now launch DECP from Steam, or by opening the EXE directly.

### Standalone

Extract the zip contents to anywhere, and run the exe. This version runs without Steam, so you won't be able to upload levels to the Steam workshop.

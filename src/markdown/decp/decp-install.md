## Steam

Replaces the vanilla level editor:

1. Find the location of the level editor exe. It's near the main game folder, in `steamapps\common\Deadbolt Level Editor`
1. Backup the vanilla editor by renaming it to `deadbolt_map_editor.vanilla.exe`
1. Extract the contents of the zip to the level editor folder

You can now launch DECP from Steam, or by opening the EXE directly.

## Standalone

Extract the zip contents to anywhere, and run the exe. This version runs without Steam, so you won't be able to upload levels to the Steam workshop.

## Open With

DECP supports using "open with", for both the Steam and Standalone builds. You can also pin DECP to your taskbar, and pin files opened with it.

If you use "open with" with the Steam build, Steam will open a popup asking you if you want to open the program with the supplied options. This happens every time, so if you use "open with" often, it is recommended that you use the Standalone build.

If you want to use "open with" using the Standalone build, and you have installed the Steam build, you need to rename the Standalone build's EXE (eg., to `deadbolt_map_editor_S.exe`). This fixes an issue where Windows will not let you use "open with" if two programs share a name.

## Music

All music in the ZIP is replaced with silence OGG files, to keep the file size down and avoid unlicensed distribution. You can replace these silent OGG files in the editor folder with the ones from the base game.

Music will still play correctly when you load the level in the main game.

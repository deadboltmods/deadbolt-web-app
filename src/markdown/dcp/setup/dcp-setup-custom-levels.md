Unlike vanilla Deadbolt, custom levels have a dedicated folder <span class="color-teal">deadbolt_game</span> appdata folder. The full path is:

`%LocalAppData%\deadbolt_game\`<span class="color-teal">Levels</span>

This folder will be created for you if it doesn't already exist. To play custom levels, just add them to this folder. You can use levels from the main game's <span class="color-teal">Stages</span> folder if you haven't made any yet.

## Using custom.json

You can set new level options for your custom levels with <span class="color-purple">custom.json</span>. A starter version is inside the DCP zip, in the <span class="color-teal">LocalAppData</span> folder.

To configure it, use this app's [Level Config tool](/config/customjson). You can also edit it manually, by referring to the explanation of the options available in [Settings](/settings#customjson).

To use your customised <span class="color-purple">custom.json</span>, place it inside your <span class="color-teal">Levels</span> folder. It will affect all other levels in that folder.

You can also publish levels with your <span class="color-purple">custom.json</span>. A guide for this is available [here](/guides#workshop-publish).

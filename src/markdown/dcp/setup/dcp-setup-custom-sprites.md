Inside the DCP ZIP, in the <span class="color-teal">LocalAppData</span> folder, you'll find a folder named Sprites. This contains every replaceable enemy sprite, as strips. The filenames tell you how many frames are on a strip (eg., `_strip8` means 8 frames).

To use custom sprites, edit these PNG files and add them to this location:

`%LocalAppData%\deadbolt_game\`<span class="color-teal">Sprites</span>

Follow the same structure as shown in the DCP zip file's <span class="color-teal">Sprites</span> folder. You can change as many or as few PNG files as you like.

Here's an example of a sprite change to Punk, who uses a folder named `Zomb1`:

<em><span class="color-r">Warning:</span> There are currently issues with arm placement when using custom sprites. This will be addressed in a later update</em>.

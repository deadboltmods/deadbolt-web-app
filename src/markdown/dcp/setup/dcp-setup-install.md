## Installation

1. Rename <span class="color-purple">data.win</span> in the DEADBOLT folder to <span class="color-purple">data.vanilla.win</span>.
1. Drop all the files from the <span class="color-teal">Game files</span> folder into the DEADBOLT folder.

## Enable features

Most mod options are disabled by default. Enable them in `DEADBOLT/JSON/`<span class="color-purple">globalconfig.json</span>

Some settings will take effect when you restart the level, others need the game to be restarted. You can restart the game immediately with Pause/Break (it's next to Scroll Lock).

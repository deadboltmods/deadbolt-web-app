Saving is possible since 1.4.0. Saves are both made <span class="color-r">and loaded</span> from a new folder, inside Deadbolt's usual save folder:

`%LocalAppData%\deadbolt_game\`<span class="color-teal">Saves</span>`\DCP`

To transfer existing vanilla save files, just copy them into this folder.

If you are playing a custom campaign from the workshop, save files will be made in a workshop ID folder, ie:

`%LocalAppData%\deadbolt_game\`<span class="color-teal">Saves</span>`\(workshop_id)`

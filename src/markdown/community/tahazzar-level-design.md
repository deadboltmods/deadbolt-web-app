# 1.Preface

I decided to create this document as a thing that I can refer back to when evaluating custom levels and to provide insights as a dude who has been practicing game design as a hobby through-out my whole life. To this day, I&#39;ve published over 50 varied custom Deadbolt maps – with obviously countless ones that I abandoned at one point or another. I don&#39;t claim to have any high authority on this subject – I just wish to represent my personal standings regarding these topics. One person that I&#39;m writing this for is myself, as I don&#39;t exactly have the best memory and this is good way to collect my thoughts that can help regarding my future efforts.

Even with its shortcomings, potential in Deadbolt&#39;s editor I find to be immense – much more than I think people give it credit for. It&#39;s a tool for recreational work that people are rarely presented so easy access to. A very concrete example of this would be the rising popularity of a game such as Mario Maker - and its upcoming sequel – though we could also refer to mods, hacks, and indeed to actual video games themselves with all the programming involved.

The collection of official campaign levels in Deadbolt is certainly perfectly serviceable bunch that gives its players an understanding of a good number of the mechanics found in the game and sells the setting of an undead underworld. However, it is one that didn&#39;t take too many risks as far as level design goes, for commercial reasons among others, and hence leaves the toolset very much open to interpretation when it comes exploring the finer details and even a number of unused concept that are functional but not present in the officially completed product.

That is not to say that I look the official game with any kind of disdain – very much the opposite of true. The game I found to be exceedingly impressive and I don&#39;t think even the developers appreciate it as much as they perhaps should. The nuanced simplicity of the game harkens back to the master pieces of the likes of original Super Mario Bros. It&#39;s totally natural flexibility and pristine elegance reaches a tier that most games can only dream to achieve.

Still, it would be unreasonable to expect that the developers themselves could after creating the engine and shipping it out in a selling package contend with the infinite potential the world at large could do with the editor – given of course that they were motivated and numerous enough.

Not only is it not easy to derive similar kind of design to that of the existing campaign, but it&#39;s also possible to provide number of experiences that cross the boundaries of the video game genres that the game as it&#39;s now is currently associated with. A single twist on a mechanic or two is enough to provide reasonably a single undead faction&#39;s worth of amount of decent gameplay, and there are much of those to be played with and to look out for. Heck, there&#39;s no limit to the number of variations you could do by merely playing with the exact same themes the official campaign uses – and up creating experiences equally enjoyable and fulfilling as the current product.

# 2.Glossary

Here I&#39;ll be explaining the basic concepts and custom phrases that I&#39;ve myself come to recognize while creating levels for Deadbolt. I&#39;ll talk about and showcase each in more detail in my level assessment showcases where they can be seen used in practical evaluation and explanation.

## 2.1.Level describing attributes

These are the ways the level can be described and categorized in general terms.

### 2.1.1.Segmented

A map that is clearly defined into separate areas – such as large rooms where enemies alerted in one room are unlikely to alert enemies in the other rooms – are what I call _segmented_. Compartmentalizing your map can be useful if you want the player to experience each section as its own obstacle, such as in the case of [_challenge runs_](#_Challenge_Run). There it&#39;s quite common to have a very clearly defined difficulty curve or choreographed solutions, which might be hampered totally if the different sections suddenly start affecting each other.

Segmentation can also happen unintentionally If, say, rooms of the map are too large. There are many scenarios where isolating the areas of the map is not desired, as it can create a lot of dead space and makes the level feel less interconnected. For example, in open-ended map it&#39;s generally not detrimental to the player experience to have enemies alert each other from various parts of the map once they discover the player.

### 2.1.2.Challenge run

A _challenge run_ type of level is one composed of back-to-back obstacles, usually [_segmented_](#_Segmented) into corridors and rooms far away from each other so as to be essentially their own isolated instances. These tend to be linear experiences that give the player a very focused experience and challenge. This is not a necessity though, as this type of level could have one or more alternative paths that the player could choose from – each right on top of each other for example.

Segmentation in these levels can also be achieved through one-way piping - for example one where the player is dropped from too high to go back to – or with one-way doorways that can be achieved as a hack by having three or more doorways on top of each other to overrule the editor&#39;s restriction of having all doors be connected.

While many types of levels gain advantage from an incremental, agile design process, a challenge run type of level is more suited for extensive pre-planning as the order in which the player is made to tackle the obstacles is highly relevant but might be something you want to change. Moving around rooms and such is not possible with the editor, so if that kind of changes are deemed necessary, they can be extremely painful to implement – to the point of needing to start the level creation from scratch.

For these reasons, one reasonable way to go about these levels is to playtest and hone each isolated segment and obstacle in isolation. Once you have determined what kind of sequence you want to put the player through, you can then piece together that chain of segments from these pre-tested rooms and level parts. This type can be quite flawed for more interconnected levels, but this is process where the isolated nature of the map can be seen as an advantage.

### 2.1.3.Interconnected

This is used to describe the nature of the map where different actions or places on the map can affect or are affected by each other. For example, pipe blocks are a rudimentary form of this in a direct but tenuous connection is created between the pipe block and its entrances. Lights can create zones of line of sight, where enemies further away can get alerted by the player&#39;s presence. Notable many of these are also things the designer can have manually occur with editor triggers.

Breaking or turning off lights, sounding microwave alarms, and knocking on doors are all actions that a player themselves can do to grab attention of enemies. Shooting with weapons to alert enemies can start a chain reaction where other enemies start moving around and congregate on the spot of disturbance.

_Interconnectivity_ tends to happen naturally in many layouts and can be somewhat difficult to specifically design for. Much of that comes down to creating somewhat enclosed layouts that guide the player toward certain actions and hence create desirable sequences. Big factor is distance - especially for events that send soundwaves such as enemy alerts and firing off weapons.

Commonly interconnectivity is useful way to enhance open-ended maps. However, it directly works against segmentation and isn&#39;t necessary something you might always want.

### 2.1.4.Choreographed

This refers to the type of design where the intended route is notably specific or &quot;tight&quot; in terms of executing it properly. An example of this would be a stealth-level that heavily discourages you from alerting the enemies. This is where the level and enemy layouts come into play as you can set up very fine-tuned lines of sight and patrols that push towards pre-planned evasive manoeuvres.

Having the outcome of being spotted here leading to large number of enemies attacking the player is what I would call a &quot;natural fail-state&quot; where one isn&#39;t immediately ejected out of the level by not doing what the designer wants but can still recover. Leaving the level open in this manner also enables the possibility of alternative challenges where the player engages with enemies even in the face of overwhelming odds that can be just as enjoyable doing the level the &quot;intended&quot; way.

Regardless, what choreographed levels often boil down to is a puzzle in the sense that the player needs to figure out what is the correct set of movements to pull through.

Clearly, this can be a frustrating experience for many, as levels of this type can be made exceedingly strict. This is doubly hurtful by having a layout that&#39;s set-up to be &quot;glunky.&quot; Ie. where the intended route is inconsistent even if the player technically executes it properly each time. On the other hand, given that the player has the right mental state, figuring out and pulling this off less artifical type of a puzzle can be exceedingly enjoyable – even after the player has mastered the correct choreography of the stage to a t.

### 2.1.5.Open-ended

An open-ended level is one that provides the player with multiple viable routes through it. Open-endedness is one of the best ways to make an engaging experience as it gives the player direct agency over their own actions. It also helps keep the level fresh for repeated playthroughs as you can switch up what you want to do once you have grown weary of pulling off a particular performance one route may task you with.

As a stealth-action hybrid, open-ended, free-roaming levels are arguably the most well-suited type of design for it. It&#39;s generally what enables the whole concept of hybrid gameplay in the first place as you can multiple routes where one might be more or less stealth oriented than the other. Particularly Deadbolt shines when the players are represented with light stealth elements where you can put yourself in a more advantageous position by taking out few guards without alerting the other enemies. This is what evokes the sneaky assassin trope that infiltrates the enemy base.

#### Sandbox-esque

This could be considered the pinnacle of open-endedness, where the layout is less a group of alternative paths, but rather a virtual environment for players to explore and experiment in. A non-mechanical factor here is how thematic and believable the setting: this is to create immersion – even if only subconsciously. In terms of functionality, high interactivity can be used to make the layout feel like a living place where the enemies haven&#39;t just been dropped in there, but rather are very much make it what it is and are inhabiting it. Perhaps one way you could try measure the &quot;sanboxiness&quot; of your level is to ask how much it feels like a game level you complete and go through rather than its own little world.

### 2.1.6.Time-sensitive

Time-sensitive sections are ones where the player is forced to act within limited time. The simplest example of this the &quot;burn all totems&quot; objective that has a concrete timer.

Similar kind of experiences may be enforced through using the trigger system with either having the player be &quot;chased&quot; by enemies or spawning in enemies in such sequence that it forces the player to be on the run. Another example of a virtual timer could be having an enemy patrolling outside of player&#39;s reach, where it reaching its destination will trigger a trap plate that makes the stage a lot harder or just resets the level.

Another type of time-sensitivity for a level could some recurring element, that instead of giving a deadline, divides time for the player into segments of alternating states. For example, the whole stage being covered in light that turns on and off every five seconds. Granted, this kind of functionality is difficult to do with the editor and gears towards doing these loops manually, which given that they can&#39;t continue indefinitely, encourages also adding a deadline for the stage. You technically think of Val&#39;s sniper scope as such as element as well.

While time-sensitive elements can act as the backbone of a level, as a driving gimmick for example, certain traps and other smaller isolated segments may also be time-sensitive. An example of this would be adding a delayed trigger spawn of some sort once the player interacts with an object, kills certain enemy, or completes an objective. Formulating your layout in such a way that the player&#39;s next action after the triggering one is likely going to be pick locking a door or safe additionally emphasizes the timing.

### 2.1.7.Survival

A survival map is one where the player isn&#39;t expected to progress so much navigating vice, but rather take out arriving enemy forces. Think &quot;tower defense&quot; games.

Generally, the area of sections where the player is expected to travel through are smaller than in free-roaming maps, which puts additional weight on making the layout interesting to travel through – even when the player is looping around them multiple times per run.

Another important factor is the method through which the enemies are delivered: are they for example dropped into the layout directly and continually, or are they coming in &quot;waves&quot;? By the way, if you don&#39;t have a skeleton totem in your level, you can spawn in and out timers to indicate the precise arrival timing of each wave, adding nice pacing to the whole process. Additionally, the direction or directions of enemy entry points are of interest.

Especially when the level is wave-based, important parts of the layout to consider are defense and vantage points.

_Defense point_ is akin to a _zone of engagement_ in that it&#39;s there where it&#39;s most advantageous for them to attack the enemies. So, a defense point could be a hallway next to swinging door, with low lightning and nearby cover objects.

_Vantage point_ is a window or a balcony where the player can relatively safely attack the enemy without the fear of retaliation. One difference between the routes that defense point tends to be on the enemy navigation route while vantage point is one where the player can see the that route but it might be much higher. Meaning that the enemies that &quot;slip past&quot; and survive through vantage point attacks may eventually end up reaching the player while they may still currently be dealing with the new upcoming enemies.

In tower defense type of levels, melee weapons are likely to be less lucrative where as explosive weapons, especially mines that can be placed to hinder certain enemy routes while dealing with other routes, are extra valuable here.

### 2.1.8.Derivative

A derivative stage is one that reuses many, if not all, of the high-level concepts chosen in another level. The level can be a callback, alternative take on the layout or a continuation of a sort. Generally derivative maps are easier to create as most of the &quot;hard decisions&quot; regarding it has been made in that other map. As such, it can be a great way to get into planning your layout fast and experimenting with design.

### 2.1.9.Event-driven, event-based

An _event-driven_ map is one where the progression is achieved and done through triggering specific events. These can be tied to the stage&#39;s objectives but can also be linked to triggering traps _(possibly tied to interactables such as cover objects)_ or collecting items _(such as invisible keycards)_. This generally creates a very script heavy experience where the player is looking for the right things to touch.

Perhaps the main reason to go for such is to create virtual objectives that can&#39;t be implemented through the ones the editor provides. This is also a way to force the player to figure something out that isn&#39;t explicitly being told to them through the game&#39;s objective text. With those you must consider how and how much is the player&#39;s next expected action telegraphed to them.

Now, obviously, this comes with a lot of package associated with it. Having your stage rely heavily on event-based triggers easily makes it feel overly scripted and constrained. Because of this, I have a hard time seeing this approach working well with levels that wish to provide open-ended experiences where the player is free to roam. However, the opposite is true: these can be used to create an almost comic strip type of sequences and enhance cutscene oriented direction. So, they can shine in stages that are focused on telling a story.

Really the hardest question comes whether and how you might want to be balance these two aspects. Certainly, in small doses, these can be a good way to trigger cutscenes to either provide quick information or as ending line without acting as too much of a disruption for the gameplay.

### 2.1.10.Weapon highlight

A _weapon highlight_ level is one where it&#39;s centered around exploring a singular weapon in depth. Certainly, every level can have sections where you are expected to take advantage of a certain weapon, but in weapon highlight that is the focal point and generally other weapons make only fleeting appearances, if at all, that act as a padding for the experience.

A weapon highlight can be considered a gimmick in that it&#39;s the main mechanical driving force for the level and defines its core essence in its entirety.

The things to focus with this type of level is to accentuate the unique properties the chosen weapon possesses – either working with or against them to bring them to the forefront. Melee weapons aren&#39;t disqualified from weapon highlight either.

Notable weapons, that are easy to focus on, are the suppressed guns because of their silence _(.25 mousegun is slightly louder but still quiet)_, special weapons not normally accessible to the player, and ones with wall-piercing bullets.

### 2.1.11.Conventional, traditional, mundane

These are the adjectives I would use on level&#39;s resembling many of the official&#39;s campaigns design. They tend to be fairly spacious environments, with one or two alternative routes and many of the sections functioning as miniature scenarios on their own because of the relatively high segmentation. There&#39;s no surreal architecture – layouts are mainly &quot;boxes with lines cutting them&quot;, so travelling through them is straight-forward.

All of this perfectly reasonable. The main grievance is that vast majority of the official campaign is all this, so we&#39;ve seen it hundred times over. Granted, there are many who enjoy doing the same thing with slight variations over and over. There&#39;s no reason to paint this in overly negatively light as it&#39;s generally safe bet, working pattern, that seems to be what the engine was built to support.

Limitation breeds creativity, so practicing this kind of design is a great way to get used to many of the nuanced factors that come into play when designing levels with the editor.

## 2.2.Level genres and sequence types

### 2.2.1.Action

An action level – or section – is one where it&#39;s intended to be impossible for player to not engage with the enemy or dispatch them in a stealthy manner. Lighting tends to favour the enemies and they often almost immediately have the line of sight to Reaper. This doesn&#39;t necessitate the use of indestructible lights as taking those out can be part of intense sequences.

As enemies tend to spot the player easily if not immediately in these maps, cover objects can play a large role here.

These levels tend to get leverage with [time-sensitive](#_Time-sensitive) elements as they further push towards player aggression. Generally, large amounts of ammunition are provided with possibility of &quot;flashy&quot; weaponry appearing being greater. In similar fashion, various explosions can be set up to explode easily in the environment for additional visual flare to pump up the player emotionally.

Given that the player is very much thrown into battles, these stages naturally gravitate toward being [choreographed](#_Choreographed_1) with certain sequences becoming the most effective.

What these levels usually look for are simulating those intense shootouts – possibly testing the player&#39;s reaction speed. It&#39;s difficult to set these in such as manner that the whole level would flow in this manner – indeed, it&#39;s perhaps not even advisable as keeping up the intensity at its highest level can be an exhausting experience. This is where [segmentation](#_Segmented_1) comes in, as way to keep the parts compartmentalize, so they are more controllable design wise, and as way to provide breaks for the player to pace out the experience more evenly.

### 2.2.2.Stealth

In these stages, player is discouraged from engaging with the enemies in a manner that will cause them to become alerted. It&#39;s much more common to have stealth-like sections in your map rather one where it&#39;s core theme. One reason for this is that you&#39;ll need an overarching looming threat through-out the level that will punish the player if they fail to remain silent.

The most obvious way to create such is just to have too many enemies in the map with not enough weaponry to deal with them though this doesn&#39;t guarantee that it can&#39;t be cleared with brute force. How much you want to enforce the stealth is a good question as it might be better to have there to be additional challenge type of option, even if it&#39;s very difficult, where players can attempt to rampage their way through the level.

Stealth levels especially tend to be heavily [choreographed](#_Choreographed_1) as usually they come down to coming up with rather specific sequences players are expected to figure out and execute. Depending on how tight _(difficult)_ you want these to be, there might end up being little room for improvisation. When these sequences become especially complicated, the level can also, or rather, be thought of as a puzzle level.

Obviously, suppressed guns, knives, mouseguns, and other silent weapons are good weapons to explore in these levels. Tempting the player with a loud weapon, such as a burst rifle or a revenant, might in fact be used as a red herring in these levels.

### 2.2.3.Platformer

This may sound weird initially given that the Reaper is unable to jump, but a lot of can be achieved by making the player drop off from various parts. Dropping off from vents to vent, from ledges to lower platforms that may not be accessible otherwise, and from ladders to ladders are all ways to tap into this genre&#39;s forte. A general thing to note is that the Reaper loses altitude fast once falling, so whatever you want the player &quot;jump&quot; towards need to be close by.

Granted, these are not the most fine-tuned elements in Deadbolt, but they can still provide some nice change of pace. The main issues here being that the controls for the manoeuvres are a bit fickle. For example, grabbing ladders while falling can be very time sensitive.

Given their limited nature, having your whole map be defined by these types of sections is not the easiest task though I can see it becoming a bigger part in the large meta in general. There isn&#39;t much precedent for this type of design in Deadbolt maps so it&#39;s quite unexplored space mechanically. A level emphasizing heavily on platforming aspects tend to require [_surreal architecture_](#_Surreal_Architecture) in the layout.

As executing successfully these tasks are fidgety, it might be better to leave these kind of challenges out as mandatory parts of a map that&#39;s otherwise &quot;normal&quot; – or at least then have them appear early on. The point is that if the player is out of nowhere faced with such a task at the end of an open-ended large layout – failing such a task is probably going to leave the player with a bitter taste if the level didn&#39;t indicate that such might sections are coming up. The main thing here comes back to the controls and the general lack of presence of these types of sections, that likely leaves most players unprepared and unaccustomed to performing such tasks – especially if no retries are time-costly.

However, little platforming challenges can be a good way to create some tension (say, jumping from ladder to ladder with tons of enemies below) and to provide optional alternative routes for the player.

### 2.2.4.Puzzle

In puzzle levels, players are tasked with interacting with objects or navigating in specific ways to &quot;solve&quot; presented situations. Making your way through a trap invested maze would be one example of this type of level. Opening pipe blocks, interacting with objects in a correct order, and merely finding your way to seemingly inaccessible places are all possible obstacles in such a level.

These usually have nothing to do with action levels but may overlap with stealth levels in many sections.

Of the three main type categories, puzzle levels are probably the ones most likely to have a need for various triggers and may feature unique concepts that are custom implemented for the stage.

### 2.2.5.Story

Story can technically play as much as a role as you want in any map. A story level specifically is one I would describe as having notable lack of actual gameplay, possibly extremely linear progression, and being heavily populated with cutscenes.

These stages tend to be [event-driven](#_Event-driven,_event-based) as a way to emphasize cutscenes, progression, and to get additional timings as when to trigger those cutscenes. For the same reasons, they are probably the type of level most likely to have multiple levels as changing the locale _(transitioning to another level)_ is a good way to the pace a story and give sense of time progressing – among other things.

These are certainly all elements you could have in pretty much any other type of level so it&#39;s technically not a category in that at least it doesn&#39;t exclude other types. However, it&#39;s arguable as just how many cutscenes you want to appear in a normal level as they are direct disruptions to gameplay flow – the player is after all literally frozen during them.

It doesn&#39;t take that many cutscenes _(say a 10 or so)_ at the start of a stage or after completing a mid-level objective, before doing a reattempt at the level ends up costing you close to a minute of just clicking through these cutscenes. Additional factor that accentuates the issue is that the game forces you to stop clicking on a specific moment to be able to skip cutscene quickly so you can&#39;t even just mindlessly click through them but must pace it a bit.

Thankfully, at least the cutscenes set to appear at the start of a stage can be set only to trigger on &quot;first run only&quot; which bypasses that issue. This becomes a problem again, if that cutscene is set to have crucial important you would rather no have the player skip, but that&#39;s hardly even related to story category so it&#39;s off-topic here.

Cutscenes work fine enough as interludes and epilogues to many missions, at least if they aren&#39;t excessive in their length. One way to reduce the number of chained cutscenes you have is to use the &quot;#&quot; character in their text that creates a line break in-game and can be used to easily fit three or four times as much text into one singular cutscene.

Regardless, cutscenes will generally always hamper replayability of a level, especially ones that are very quick-paced, intense, and long. It may be preferable to look for other types of avenues for storytelling beyond textual information – such as environmental storytelling where its more optional and less &quot;deal with this.&quot;

Now, it&#39;s possible to go into the extreme ends with these and use level editor&#39;s capabilities to create essentially &quot;gameplay free&quot; experiences which could be equated with short films. That getting quite far from level design though, so it&#39;s not worth going into here in my opinion.

### 2.2.6.Boss battle, boss Rush (TODO)

TODO

### 2.2.7.Other

This is just a place to throw out all the other concepts one may come up with that don&#39;t really fall into the other main three categories (action, stealth, and puzzle). These can be ones which fundamentally deviate from the normal gameplay Deadbolt features. As such, it&#39;s impossible to cover this category fully.

Most obvious example is perhaps the sniper scope level, where player is put into a &quot;Where&#39;s Waldo&quot; scenario or tasked with properly timing the shots to take out patrolling enemies.

A more esoteric example would be a secret hunt, where player is tasked to find hidden interactables or areas. Yet another would be a level that boils down to solving a labyrinth composed of piping. With level editor&#39;s trigger and transition objects you can also pull of memory game type stages. Then you could also have Reaper fall down a long vertical chasm filled with landmines so that they need to slither their way through it by quickly adjusting their horizontal position. This, however, could be categorized as a [platformer](#_Platformer,_platforming_sequence) instead.

There&#39;s really no limit here to be honest. The main issue is whether these can be made interactive enough to be worth revisiting for example. Notably, all the examples I provided in the last paragraphs are levels that can end up being very superficial and simple – lacking in complexity.

Because of this difficulty in making this type of premise anything more than a curiosity, it&#39;s common to feature these as short sections in a map – or as short transition levels in multipart stages. However, there lie potential issues as well, mainly these tend to be break mechanical and thematic consistency and can end up feeling off-putting in an otherwise cohesive experience.

I would speculate that intermingling the core mechanics of these gimmick levels – dispending them through-out an otherwise level might be one effective strategy though I haven&#39;t experimented with such and I can see it being difficult, as it&#39;s very much a case-by-case kind of deal with each of these ideas being so radically different.

## 2.3.Concepts

Other terms, such as different sections that might appear in the level, are listed here.

### 2.3.1.Preliminary loadout

Sometimes a level is so time-sensitive or packed into such small place that having Reaper&#39;s car be accessible isn&#39;t possible in a satisfying manner. For these scenarios, I came up with the concept of preliminary &quot;choose your loadout&quot; level where the player can pick up their initial weapon before being transitioned to the actual stage.

This took a considerable amount of work to make it work using the editor&#39;s functionality, but I&#39;m more than pleased with it. It does unfortunately have this little grievance where it will only allow the player take with them a single weapon – be it primary or secondary – but not both. Technically I do have a solution available where it would allow the player have both selected, but it does also increase the player&#39;s death count by 1 and is ever so slightly slower as some time is needed for the game to register the player&#39;s weapon choices before they can be killed and moved to the following stage with that load out.

Here&#39;s this template as an attachment:

![](RackMultipart20220329-4-1ektwg8_html_9da14ce07f45fa82.gif)

Note that it uses a considerable number of Reaper apartment assets that aren&#39;t available in the editor and hence it can&#39;t be opened with it until all those are replaced with objects listed in the editor. Currently, this loops back to itself, so to use it for your stage, you need to use a text editor to manually change lv0\_1.nc into the file you want to transition.

When packaging this with other files, remember that the came will load multi-level stages alphabetically.

### 2.3.2.Central hub

A _central hub_ is a section of the map that the level tends to fold back into and is generally the most connected point between the other parts of the map. It can be tied to the concept of [_set piece_](#_Set_Piece)as the two play well of each other.

This kind of hub is a good way to create [_open-endedness_](#_Open-Endedness) to a level as it&#39;s one of the main ways to give player choices – in which order to tackle the areas of the map and how to navigate through its layout.

### 2.3.3.Set piece

A _set piece_ is an area of the level, an empty space, or a decorative section of the stage that&#39;s usually used to draw players attention. It&#39;s a good way to accentuate certain areas – such as _central hubs_ – and liven up the general look of the level.

Purposefully creating and using set pieces might not seem to be much that of particular relevance. This is only superficially true: a set piece can indeed &quot;sell&quot; the setting and the map to the player as well for the designer. Coming up with the concept of a set piece can be the driving spark and source of inspiration for the level thematic core that will help flesh it out to completion.

### 2.3.4.Gimmick

A _gimmick_ is a focus on level on a particularly novel mechanical aspect that is to set the level slightly apart from its other contemporises. It doesn&#39;t have to specifically complex or deep – in fact, the very opposite may be true as a simple twist on a familiar mechanic is more focused, probably more memorable, and easier to handle and balance a mechanical from design standpoint.

Playing of a novel gimmick can be an interesting exploration of it mechanically and rewarding for the player and for the designer. It can for example shed new light on a familiar mechanic and given deeper understanding of the base mechanics the game uses.

Gimmick can also be something &quot;way out there&quot; that turns the game on its head and provides the player with an unusual experience that isn&#39;t seen in more traditional levels.

    1.
### Dynamic duo

This technically could be called &quot;triple threat&quot; or whatever as it isn&#39;t strictly speaking limited to the concept of &quot;duo&quot; albeit that is perhaps the most effective and refined way to utilize it.

The idea here is to limit the usage of different enemy types to as few as possible. The reasons to do so are manifold. One reason to do so is memorability as this kind of seemingly limiting factor can give it character that the player is more likely remember. Similarly, this can be a thematic note that through showing, not telling, gives some background to the setting presented.

Probably the most value is gained mechanically speaking, since having a distinct pair that play off each other can set up certain kind of &quot;background noise&quot; to way the level plays. This is because regardless where you are located in the map, the enemy type restriction makes it so you are playing off the artificial intelligence of these particular foes that stays constant.

A very basic example would be pairing some type of melee enemy with a ranged enemy. Here, the melee range combat is now dictated by the way that enemy works while the way the flow of long ranged combat is determined by the peculiarities of that ranged enemy type. Obviously, the better these two enemy types support each other in the setting in question, more it can help to make that duo memorable and better the player experience.

### 2.3.2.Thematic notes, thematic core

These can be overarching or small details that sets-up or plays into a theme the level has. This better explained through concrete examples, but I&#39;ll have this here as a reference point. Without going into too much detail, a level&#39;s theme may be mechanically inclined, focused towards exploring the setting, or a story point. Thematic elements don&#39;t have to be immediately evident to the player and may work as &quot;background noise&quot; to the greater whole.

Very much like a literature piece, a custom level may have a reoccurring motif that is inspiring both its aesthetics and mechanics indirectly.

### 2.3.3.Memorability

Memorability is how well the player is likely to remember the level after playing it. This is the main push what concepts such as [_gimmicks_](#_Gimmick), [_set pieces_](#_Set_Piece), and [_thematic notes_](#_Thematic_Note) try to achieve. The idea is the create experiences that leave the player with any kind of an impression – be it awe, confusion, anxiety, feeling like an invincible bad-ass, or even things like frustration. It doesn&#39;t need to be limited to positives or negatives. Variety is the spice of life, and that is where for many the enjoyment from it comes from.

Failing to create a memorable experience plays a big role in making your level feel bland and the player themselves empty as they forget about ever even testing out the level. From this standpoint, it&#39;s better to leave the player with at least negative emotions since those are at least something that they can think back to. Obviously, continually torturing the playerbase might leave them feel abused or being trodden on, but on the other hand, overcoming seemingly impossible odds is one of the greatest driving forces of human psyche. In contrast to this a hollow or bland experience leaves the player with less nothing and can feel like a waste of their time.

A memorable gameplay session can intrigue and invigorate its player –leave them thinking about the thematical or mechanical implications that the level&#39;s design represented them with. As stated before, it can also be about giving them a learning experience – a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the game or of life itself in terms of storytelling.

### 2.3.4.Linearity

This is the opposite of [_open-endedness_](#_Open-Endedness).

_Linearity_ in terms of level design refers for it made up from sequence of challenges where the player has little choice in terms of order in which they might want to tackle the obstacles the map may present. This is the most effective way to keep the level focused on a particular chain of events such as challenge run type of design.

Unfortunately, linearity can also merely be a result of seemingly unfinished layout. For example, a level that seems like it would work well as a free-roam open-ended level with no particular reason to have the player navigate in certain order, restricted by the lack of piping, making it impossible to make choices as to where to start unravelling the level.

Similarly, this can manifest itself in a level even if there are piping, when most of those routes are unviable in terms of progression at the start of level and only give the player the illusion of choice. This I would write off as poor balancing by the designer.

As a side note, giving such false choices isn&#39;t necessarily bad practice itself if it can give the player a relevant experience. This usually meaning that this route being the &quot;wrong way&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily obvious from first glance. Obviously, this can be frustrating if it happens deep into the level or that when the fact that this is the &quot;wrong way&quot; becomes only apparent after a considerable long amount of playing.

### 2.3.5.Surreal architecture, nonconventional architecture

Peculiar architecture in the level layout can add much to the level&#39;s appeal and memorability. One of my main gripes with the official campaign maps – as well as with many of the custom maps made by others – is the seeming lack of involvement in trying to create an interesting environment for the player – and the enemies - to navigate though.

Obviously, for foes certain kind of room formations can become hard for them to understand but given enough work this isn&#39;t nearly as much of a problem as one might imagine. Having an enemy or two staring at the wall isn&#39;t the end of the wall. Like all things you can go too far with this, such as when almost every single enemy on the level end up being stuck in some corner since they have no idea whatsoever as to where to go to when they become alerted.

Especially when the alternative is the have the traditional pile of squares, this type of surreal architecture can easily be used to create more imaginative environments that make the player think of the setting and the game from a new perspective.

That is not to say that this kind of level design is strictly better in terms of design – the main thing here comes back to representation. Is pizza better than lasagne? No really. Would you want to eat pizza for a week straight or be able to mix and match the two to switch up? I would image &quot;yes&quot; unless you specifically hate one or the other here. The point is that these classic squares cut by a line or two has been explored to death and is something the players have been presented with again and again through-out pretty much every single official campaign level.

Alleviating this doesn&#39;t even necessitate the usage of insanely complex formations but can done through merely adding balconies as drop points or ledges, and trailer stairs to create some slightly uneven elevation between rooms. Windows can also similarly be used to open the level and add a bit more nuance to lines of sight for example.

Designing free-form architecture can be exciting, especially for creative people, but you should always keep the scale of your map in mind as well. I note this specifically here, since going all crazy with level&#39;s layout easily swells it into overly large proportions. Such maps can end up being unnecessary confusing, have too much dead space, and slow down framerates for many PCs.

# 3.Enemies

## 3.1.Enemy statistics

See [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1181191369](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1181191369)

## 3.2.Enemy types

### 3.2.1.Punk

This is the de-facto enemy type, arguably also the most iconic and expressive of them all. It has four different states: idle, smoking, sitting, and sleeping – technically five if you count patrolling. Punks have little health and a weapon such as suppressed 9mm pistol is seemingly made to take them out. They are also quite easy to punch to death in straight-forward melee.

Still, they have reasonable reach, so given lighting and line of sight, they can cause some trouble for the player. This leads to another point, which is that Punks, as weak ranged enemies, are considerably less effective in darkness. That is a factor that can be used to create exceptional layouts with high enemy count while keeping them situations which the player has good control over.

There&#39;s somewhat esoteric mechanic associated with Punk&#39;s sleeping state: if you instead of holding down the movement key, move past sleeping Punks by tapping the movement key, they don&#39;t become alerted. This can be an interesting thing to play with in stealth-oriented sections.

All of this makes Punk the best &quot;filler&quot; enemy to have on parts of the map that you feel like need that little something. Obviously, you should keep in mind whether they are a match thematically and shouldn&#39;t use them in every stage. Another concern is that you don&#39;t want to run out the enemy type&#39;s novelty – variety is the spice of life. Punk is regardless one of the safest bets when looking to place a minor obstacle onto the map.

### 3.2.2.Succubus / Amber

The Succubi are another expressive enemy – and one of the few non-bosses who are females _(along with Maidens)_. It&#39;s likely the most dynamic melee enemy, with it being able to attack from ceilings and rise from sitting positions or being awakened from dancing trance. It&#39;s very quick to close out distances and it has this nice weight and rhythm to its attack pattern that makes it possible for a player to avoid it perpetually – at least while they are only facing single one.

Partly because of their speed, but also because of their similarly elongated bodies to that the Incubi also have, executing headshots on them can be a bit more difficult than usual. Especially at close range. Taking out a Succubus is possible even with fists alone, but it&#39;s somewhat risky business _(and a bit slow)_ and generally it&#39;s recommended that you don&#39;t expect the player to do that with any kind of regularity.

Another easily unnoticed difference to most other enemies, is the color coding of the Succubus. While other enemies are seen in shades of browns, blacks, greys, and lime greens – the Succubi are mostly defined by their distinct and bright red full skirts.

Succubi share all the varied states of their male counterpart, the Incubi. Succubi can idle, patrol, sit, dance, and do all of that while being upside down vertically. Unlike the Incubi however, Succubi on the ceiling will always &quot;dismount&quot; immediately when becoming alerted and have no attack to perform while upside-down. If they know the player&#39;s location, they will heavily gravitate towards them even mid-air, while falling, which is an interesting detail. This can be a quite threating sight – especially in tight corridors where a Succubus might essentially drop right on the player&#39;s face, making dispatching it more difficult.

**Dancing vampires** could be categorized as an enemy type of their own given you generally don&#39;t want to disrupt them. They provide a great way to block out ranged attack lines to other enemies or to light sources. Having other enemies mingled with dancing vampires also makes melee combat less lucrative as the waking up the dancers can be difficult in close quarters. While dancers will keep dancing even as they see corpses or enemies getting killed, they will alert other close-by enemies, which is an interesting little mechanic.

With dancing vampires, you can create _zones of engagement_ through exclusion as players naturally avoid areas where dancers are congregated. All in all, dancers in general give access to something that&#39;s more akin to an environmental hazard rather than a standard enemy and are as such an invaluable asset in a designer&#39;s toolbox.

**Amber** , one part of the twin boss, is in many ways similar to a Succubus. Main differences are that she&#39;s faster and tougher. An important thing to remember is that Amber has no falling animation and she trying to enter such will crash the game. This needs to be taken into account in your layout so that she&#39;s unlikely to drop off from any ledge. Amber being killed – if Evelyn is already dead or not present – will initiate a cutscene during which the player is unable to move. This is another thing you want to keep in mind, so the player isn&#39;t getting killed while being unable to react.

### 3.2.3.Incubus

Incubi use 10mm pistols, though they don&#39;t drop it, which is a wall-piercing weapon so they might be able to damage the player when they would against other ranged enemies be safe. They have uniquely haphazard attack where one of their first shots at the Reaper tends to go way off the mark, which gives the player slight additional time to evade or take them out.

As mentioned in the Succubus chapter, Incubus share all the states with them. The **dancer** mechanics are identical, and you can note them on that [Succubus chapter](#_Dancing_Vampires).

**Evelyn** is the other part of the twin boss of Amber and Evelyn and the counterpart functionally to Incubus. She is tougher than the Incubi and seems to sport a higher attack rate though I think her reloading also takes more time. Like Amber, there&#39;s the problem of not having a falling animation and having an innately scripted cutscene upon being killed.

### 3.2.4.Bartender

A good way to get player engagement and agency to put forth a goal that is completed by using the game&#39;s mechanics directly rather than relying on the objective system.

This is a surprisingly easy way to create a novel experience as it turns the standard enemy into a boss battle of its own – indeed this is premise with Madame Stela herself, but with Bartenders you can also play around with the number of Phylacteries and Bartenders. This is what I call a **p**** hylactery **** h ****unt****.**

For example, if you have a great open-ended free-roaming map, you can turn it into epic quest by having Bartenders here and there with phylacteries along the different sides of the map. Finding out which Bartender is connected to which bottle, where those bottles are located and how to route your progression through the level so that you can take out a phylactery and reap the rewards of that by taking out the corresponding Bartender can be immense fun when done correctly – this relying mainly on the level layout and enemy placements.

Regardless of my upcoming rant about &quot;Bottle Service&quot; at the end of this chapter, what _you_ can do with phylactery hunt type of motivational goal is to create an extremely natural way to interconnect the mechanics of the enemy type with the layout and build sub-level correlation between two seemingly unrelated places. Bartender being the enemy that also provides a considerable powerful weapon in the form of combat shotgun works as a nice interjectory reward to really motivate the player towards completing the task even when they still have more additional phylactery Bartenders to go through.

Speaking of the weaponry, a combat shotgun is a very strong weapon and just one or two Bartenders in your level can make that weapon be one of the main ones in the map so it&#39;s something you might want to be wary of.

On a more technical side, if you have some Bartenders with phylacteries and others in the same level that don&#39;t have any corresponding bottles, this seems like it leads to random crashes whenever one of them is killed. This doesn&#39;t seem to be always the case though so further experimentation for this is still required. Obviously, this is undesirable so it&#39;s probably better to refrain from mixing it up this way and either have none of the Bartenders have phylacteries or all of them have them. Bartender&#39;s phylactery bottles can also act as nice decorative element.

**Madam Stela** is mechanically very similar to Bartender. The differences are that Stela is much faster than a Bartender, tougher, has very short reloading time, and barely flinches when being shot.

Unlike the Bartender phylacteries, having Madam Stela&#39;s bottles in a map without Stela herself instantly crashes the game upon loading the map so they aren&#39;t as applicable as decorative elements. Technically you could place a Stela out of bounds, but this would still initiate randomly the pseudo cutscenes _(during which player can move)_ where Madam complains about the bottles if they are being broken. I&#39;m not sure how despawning Stela would work here as I haven&#39;t tried.

#### Rant about &quot;Bottle Service&quot;

There&#39;s much you can do with this mechanic and this is also seen to some extent in the official campaign in the level &quot;Bottle Service.&quot; Given all the praise I&#39;ve given to the mechanic itself, it would be easy to assume the said &quot;Bottle Service&quot; would be one of my favourites, but in the instance of this level I find it passable.

Forcefully shoehorning the player go through technically unkillable enemies is never quite satisfying - especially when it&#39;s not really a choice the player can make themselves - it&#39;s not visceral and feels like a waste of ammo even when it isn&#39;t. Having all the phylacteries all in the same location - the blandest possible choice by the way - and that being one annoying to get into doesn&#39;t seem like a particularly engaging and is akin to a puzzle that I don&#39;t feel pairs particularly well with pre-established part where the player is directly forced to go through those Bartenders in any case.

The level has a lot of pacing around with opening pipe valves as you&#39;re trying to make out the purposefully convoluted piping. I don&#39;t find this particularly thrilling. The level does eventually loop back into itself in a satisfying manner so that&#39;s certainly something.

The whole &quot;burn drugs&quot; as a side quest especially feels more like a bore and a waste of time that doesn&#39;t seem to play into the level&#39;s main thematic focus. It does at least act as a guidance of sorts as to where to go and how to route your playthrough. Still, having to click through every one of them each time you play can&#39;t feel that great. Image if you accidentally miss one or two on a more obscure location and have to tackle your way back to it – to an artificially interactable object that has no functional relevance for you other than to complete the objective. That&#39;s just drivel. This Is additionally compounded by the pipe valves that are even easier to miss though they at least have actual importance in opening up the routing.

### 3.2.5.Shambler

Shambler is the most unique zombie faction member and provides plenty of alternative gameplay that can&#39;t be emulated with other enemies. The placement of Shambler heads are important questions. They can be used as vivid décor and in the presence of &quot;active&quot; Shamblers _(ones with bodies)_ as distractions. In this way, they also function as traps that can alert other enemies. This means you can somewhat emulate the functionality of zombie cameras if you make the Shambler&#39;s actual body unreachable _(out of map&#39;s bounds)_.

Shambler bodies without the sight of their head are helpless and can be slowly beaten to death with little resistance. Given this is an easy way for the player to gain access to SMG rounds, it is a lucrative course of action, but might be something you don&#39;t really want to encourage.

Unique mechanic exists when it comes to Shamblers and keycards. This one is similar to _phylactery hunt_ in that you can use an enemy type to create a link between two different places of the map. Notably, when a Shambler carrying a key is killed, the key will drop from its body – not from its head – but the Shambler can still be taken out by beheading it without having interaction with its body.

This is a concept I&#39;ve used on [&quot;Heads On Prices](#_Heads_On_Prices)&quot;, but I do think there is still more to it. A thing from the top of my mind, that might be a cute [_gimmick_](#_Gimmick) to design around, is for example having there be reasons to intentionally lure the body towards you by alerting the head – and that doesn&#39;t even need keycards to be involved in it at all.

### 3.2.6.Roland

Roland is peculiar in the sense that he never quite felt to me like a &quot;real&quot; boss enemy since he has no innate special scripting associated with him and is somewhat comparable in difficulty to an enemy such as the demon Patriarch.

Using Rolands in this reversed manner as normal obstacle feels to me like a natural extension of the official campaign in terms of difficulty and providing the player with an enemy type they haven&#39;t spent that much time tackling with. However, Rolands don&#39;t drop any weaponry and are quite bullet spongy so it may be better to refrain from dropping three or more of them close to each other.

## 3.3.General (Lich)

While Generals are not able to hide in the ground like the other skeletons, they are the one equipped with the most unique power of all the enemies: the power of resurrection. They can &quot;smell out&quot; nearby corpses and will gravitate towards them. Resurrection process itself takes few seconds. They are unable to resurrect fully all enemies – in those cases they end up creating a Grunt instead as a replacement.

Because of this power, Lich is perhaps the most annoying enemy to have spawn as backup as it can undo much of the progress the player has done through resurrecting killed enemies. This is also a way to create a novel timed challenge, where the player is in a rush to take out the Lich before it can go about resurrecting all the dead. A notably example of this concept in practise can be seen in the official campaign&#39;s level &quot;Bar Hopping.&quot;

Liches are so drawn towards resurrecting corpses that they will in fact do it to Reaper&#39;s corpse as well. Enemies that have been blow to bits, like ones taken out from exiting the toilet, or enemies that have been ashified can&#39;t be resurrected and won&#39;t draw the attention of Generals. The urge the Liches have for corpses can be used to your advantage in enemy layouts as it has a notable long range. In this manner, a Lich can technically become alerted without hearing anything suspicious. A chain sequence may emerge from killing a single enemy, even perfectly stealthily, that will end up alerting the whole building because Liches were drawn to that corpse.

The plasma projectiles that Liches throw out ashifies the Reaper in one-shot. This special weaponry can also be given out to the player, but it requires manual file editing. It&#39;s an interesting weapon with numerous unique properties and certainly worth exploring. An example of a level, where the Lich arm is the [_weapon highlight_](#_Weapon_highlight_1), is my [&quot;Cold Embrace&quot;](#_Cold_Embrace) map.

Liches are the tallest of all enemies and as such can easily get stuck in various low-ceiling corridors. Additional fact that pronounces this is that they have this floaty movement where they hover above the ground. Vertically extended regular doors and mansion doors are recommended to make sure Generals can travel through them.

Generals leave no corpses behind _(so they can&#39;t resurrect each other)_ and are relatively weak: only few revolver shots will make them explode.

In most scenarios Liches can&#39;t be taken out by punching, but with careful positioning the player may place the Reaper right &quot;inside them&quot; in a way that their projectile weapon can&#39;t hit them. From this spot punching a Lich to death is trivial.

## 3.5.Enemy Spam

Using large number of enemies can be good way to increase the difficulty of a map. It can also easily be abused badly to create horrible gameplay experiences where the player is into repeating boring patterns of mop-out duty where they are cleaning out enemies that come in masse.

This Is where they might be forced to use slow tactics to lure enemies over in order to get to handle them in the environment more suited for them. An example of this kind of abuse of the gameplay patterns In Deadbolt would be trying to get enemies facing walls and then taking out a group of 10+ enemies with a single Sledgehammer with for example. This is akin to what is known in 3d games as &quot;bottle necking&quot; where enemies are forced into a small corridor where they can be taken out one-by-one.

Clearly even this type of level design can be pulled of in an enjoyable manner though I find it rather questionable with the mechanics of Deadbolt where a limitless number of enemies maybe layered on top of each other.

The mechanical premise is indeed hard to handle in a way that would create an enjoyable experience but not impossible. This could certainly play well in a &quot;tower defence&quot; type of a map where the enemies come in timed waves from certain directions. Another good place would be the use enemies that are limited in some capacity, making handling them less of an issue even when grouped together closely. Providing the player with high manoeuvrability in such a level could also play a role in accentuating the importance of that advantage the player has over the enemies even when faced with an overwhelming amount of them.

Unfortunately, enemy spam that isn&#39;t being supported by clever layout or setting ends up being a tedious experience and can be a result of lazy design where enemies were literally spammed all over as an attempt to raise the difficulty of a map in a quick manner.

### 3.5.1.Enemy Spam + Weapon Spam

Utilizing enemy spam design tends to - because of its similarly excessive nature - also call upon the concept of weapon spam, where a section of the map, generally a single spot is littered with a crap ton of weaponry. With this the player is either tasked into running back forth between that place the advantage point where they are artillery bombing the enemy crowds, or in instances where the enemies are close by, merely challenged with the task of picking up the right weapons in a steady manner while shooting at the general direction of that enemy mass. This generally end up being a dry gameplay experience even if it&#39;s visually impressive.

### 3.5.2.Enemy Spam + Explosive Weaponry

Also akin to weapon spam, Technician in these types of levels tend to be a common occurrence which makes sense at face-value as they provide free mines that can be utilized to take out large number of enemies at once. However, this also plays even further into the already overly excessive nature these stages have – adding more randomness to an already annoying inconsistency that large amount of random types of enemies rushing all over creates.

Another extremely dangerous factor here, especially with large number of enemies that is already a set-up to make the game run on a lower framerate, is that explosions are resource intensive and the easiest way to straight-up crash the game, which clearly is something you should try to avoid as much as possible. Especially with all the baiting these types of levels tend to force the player into, which can be time-consuming, this plays into Technicians&#39; bad habit of constantly planting mines as long as they are alerted which doesn&#39;t take too long to create a mine pile that, if triggered, will most assuredly end with you getting your game forcefully closed right in front of your eyes.

# 4.Editor&#39;s functionality

Here I mark my quick notes on the tools available with the editor and with the potential pitfalls I feel they may have design wise. These are brief, listing only few, and emphasize design aspects – you can find guides and resources to the technicalities of triggers and such elsewhere where they have been covered extensively.

## 4.1.&quot;Kill all enemies&quot; objective

asdasd

Dancers

## 4.2.Doors

Doors are ways to have natural way to transition between rooms.

There are few common technical issues related to doors. Taller vampires (Incubus, Succubus, Bartender, and the boss ones) have trouble getting through the default doors. This can easily be rectified by setting the door&#39;s y-scale to 1.2 (a 20% increase in height).

Doors don&#39;t work properly if you try to have them connect to middle of that room in such a way that you would enter it through a balcony or trailer stairs. For this you might need to painstakingly create the walling of the room from multiple smaller boxes. This can initially be quite confusing but in the end, it isn&#39;t that hard of a concept to grasp and you get used to it. It does unfortunately deter you from making certain kind of architecture given how painful it can be to make those work properly.

## 4.3.Cutscenes

Cutscenes are a way to provide the player with context through textual information. A common usage is to have ones appear at the start of the level to explain the current situation and what is expected of the player. Given their disruptive nature to the flow of gameplay, it&#39;s generally recommended to set these types of cutscenes to be &quot;first run&quot; only – especially in the case of story oriented ones - unless they are trying to provide the player with mechanically relevant information that they indeed _need_ to get the level and would be in trouble if they accidentally skipped through the dialog on their first run.

Obviously, an extreme bad example of this type of dialog spam would be a large, open-ended &quot;kill all enemies&quot; map with 20+ chained cutscenes set to run at the start of it each time.

Similarly, cut scenes are also used to indicate the transition of one objective to another and to explain the results of a course of action. For these the &quot;first run only&quot; doesn&#39;t actually really work, since iirc the &quot;first run only&quot; indeed refers to the actual first time the level is booted – not the first time the dialog would be shown. This means that if the player dies before ever reaching that objective, they would now never see it as they failed to reach it during their first run.

## 4.4.Multi-staged levels

The editor provides a way to upload zip archives that may contain any number of maps that can be transitioned from each other. This is feature that is very easy to overuse. As far as I can see, the actual applicable functionality is relatively limited – more fit to create elaborate cutscenes. A good example of a two-part map would be one where there is a small, establishing map that sets out the general feel and premise, which then transitions to the &quot;real deal.&quot;

Now, stringing together seemingly unrelated, even merely middle-sized open-ended maps is a quick way to infuriate the player. First off, once the player realizes that this indeed is a multi-part stage, it instantly drains involvement from them as they very often aren&#39;t provided with any way of knowing how long it will go on and they lose sight of any tangible goal.

Also, once you enter a second similar stage after finishing a 10-minute or so long open-ended map, you are going to be much more pressured – you&#39;re are now forcefully invested in the level and quitting out will make you lose concrete progress. This is gets progressively worse the longer this goes on and the more levels the player is expected complete in this sequence. The player&#39;s attention is continually being moved away from the stages themselves and towards getting through the current one just to get to the next one.

A big question there is whether anything would be lost if these chained maps would each be their own stage. Especially in the case of maps where they are loosely connected at best, I see no justifying reason to string them together. Each of them very harshly loses focus this way and can become more of an annoying obstacle to get to the next stage as the level isn&#39;t no longer about any single one of them but rather about an ambiguous over-arching goal. This is where thematic notes, mechanic focuses, and all such become muddled and less contextualized.

Beyond all that, level transitions themselves provide ways to have branching paths and other choices. Whether such mechanics will provide anything that isn&#39;t merely side dressing in these generally very small scopes of custom levels is still up in the air I feel. This is another avenue that pushes for longer and larger stages, which as I pointed out, is a highly questionable design direction.

Granted, large epic type of maps can be engrossing, if the player is looking for a longdf experience, the player engagement can be kept up through-out, while having larger thematical lines that keep it cohesive. That is easier said than done though. Keeping spotlight limited on a few themes in a single map is a great way to create poignant experiences, that are easier to get in and out of, and be more memorable in that they don&#39;t overload the player with information.

# 5.Difficulty

This topic is way out of scope for this documentation, but I can touch upon it here briefly. The main thing to understand with difficulty is that it&#39;s very much subjective: some people find certain type of challenges harder and others easier, players like to be challenged to different lengths and are looking for time-consuming experiences, younger people have greater reflection times, some have played through action games through-out their whole lives, and there are even outside factors such as people having different PC set-ups where their screens are darker – making it harder to navigate through dark sections.

This is the reason why I am personally yet to use the provided workshop tags of &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;Hard&quot; since I don&#39;t really have much of a way in terms of evaluating what makes each what. At what point would a supposedly &quot;Medium&quot; stage become &quot;Hard.&quot; Is it the expected number of player deaths? The number of enemies present on the level? The average amount of time it takes to complete? How likely it&#39;s going to make the user rage-quit? What percentage of the playerbase can figure out the intended solution within 10 minutes to the presented scenario? I guess there could be some algorithm that could be created to get some indication of the general difficulty but that is all speculative given those statistics won&#39;t become available – certainly not in the quantity such evaluation would require to be truly trustworthy.

Difficulty can play a role in making a level very strict by only representing a singular unforgiving route to the player. As opposed to this, a more relaxed with plenty of ammunition for example is obviously going to provide more in terms of freedom of choice. However, if the level requires little to no strategy it becomes questionable why even bother playing it since there&#39;s no unique challenge provided to overcome and nothing to be gained in that sense. This is the balancing act of balancing a level mechanically speaking, where there is generally a desire to provide players with situations that tax them mentally yet provide enough freedom for them to be creative in terms of coming up with those solutions.

At this point I should note that this also isn&#39;t an absolute right in terms of level design. A contrary example of this would be puzzle design, that isn&#39;t necessarily creative in the number of correct answers (say, having only one intended solution) though the process of figuring the thing out can still be very engaging.

## 5.1.&quot;It&#39;s unfair&quot;

Difficulty discussion is easily where you can end being derailed discussions about &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; challenges, which might be coming from a wrong angle as they try to paint certain type of obstacles as subjectively bad. Personally, I believe where bad design becomes realized is when incompatible concepts are paired together and clash against each other.

&quot;Troll&quot; design of &quot;pick a door&quot; / &quot;trial and error&quot; sections I found mostly be evaluated by everything that came before them. If this kind of thing happens at the very end of a tasking level where it takes a single run for 20 something minutes to reach, only forcing the player restart because of a &quot;cheap trick&quot; we might be talking trouble. However, if the level is something more akin to practiced mechanical repeating performance that takes few minutes to pull off, the loss isn&#39;t that much. Indeed, with such as level where much of its about mastering a cycle of sorts, repeated plays aren&#39;t that bad as it&#39;s what you have constantly been doing for all along and would keep doing if you would ever replay the level. This is actually where linearity can shine and where open-endedness can become extremely hostile as pairing the creative, adaptive process that might involve luck elements and taking chances to begin with to have a superior performance can be demolished by cheap death that they couldn&#39;t foresee and now have to re-attempt to do a inconsistent execution of the level again where the last one was robbed from them. In contrast to this the linear, choreographed stage is one that slowly becomes easier after each playthrough as the player starts getting the clean patterns down so doing a repeated run is less of a hazzle.

What we&#39;re talking about is at how much is at stake when the player is expected to be a make choice or notice a small detail that can end their current run. How early is it in the level? If it&#39;s right in the beginning, it close to irrelevant and bears little impact. Is it difficult or multi-nuanced to get to the point? An example of place where it could be quite painful is right after of a &quot;kill all enemies&quot; objective in a large, free-roaming map with multiple routes that involves smoking out the enemies from their safe zones and such.

# 6.General Level Development Tips

## 6.1.Naming your level

A level&#39;s name can serve many purposes. One being that it will afterwards remind the player as to what the level was about and helps distinguishing it from other maps. Name can even technically be part of the experience if it explains the setting, makes a quip about it, or if it sheds a new angle on what is being represented.

The title of your level tends to be the very first thing any player come across so it&#39;s especially important when it comes to first impressions. I would recommend staying away from click-bait titles as with those you quickly start losing thrust and disappointing the players when it comes hinting what your level is about but fail to deliver what they were expecting.

This admittedly isn&#39;t the most important factor when it comes to a custom map, but it certainly can add value easily in terms of making the level memorable and backing up the premise for the challenge you&#39;re presenting. It&#39;s not something you should get too caught on – you can name the level after finishing up every other aspect. The process of creating the level fully might get you a better sense of what the name should try to convey.

## 6.2.Getting started

Coming up with a gimmick, a set piece, a thematical setting, or a weapon highlight are all ways from which you can start working on a level. Inspiration comes in all shapes and forms. You might even work your way backwards by first coming up with the title and the fireplace&#39;s rhyme before you begin creating the map&#39;s layout.

If you aren&#39;t in particularly creative mood, you can easily just as well do a derivative work of an existing level. You can either choose to mimic it or expand upon the potential ideas set out by it. A very by the numbers exercise is to take an official level, use the existing rooms but switch their locations around. Another common one, that is easy to get into, is to take an existing layout and then change the faction that it&#39;s populated by. For example, take an official Zombie Kingz map, delete all the enemies and start placing various vampires there as replacement.

Open-ended layouts are the more relaxed ones in terms of design in that you don&#39;t really to have to come up with and test specific or convoluted scenarios. Especially in sandbox-esque settings you can focus more on getting the &quot;feel&quot; of the environment right through incremental development – continually adding rooms and adjusting location of enemies slightly. The less segmented and choreographed the level, the more lax can be the process of developing it.

Alternatively, you can also sketch out in paper the general layout of a map. Given your level isn&#39;t meant to be super choreographed, there&#39;s no need to get stuck in the details. Much of that you might resolve merely while going through the editor&#39;s assets.

A great way to stay focused is to start small. Maybe even with single room or two. Don&#39;t hustle to lay out large parts of the stage before playtesting the level. It&#39;s generally much easier to add and expand than it is to reduce. Editor&#39;s limitations are also a big factor here as deleting rooms with it isn&#39;t the most pleasing experience nor is it possible to move rooms around.

A common wisdom to remember is that best designs are also often the simplest and cleanest. Complexity has many costs associated with it and it should only be dispensed with the respect it&#39;s due.

  1.
## On development process

Playtest, playtest, playtest. If you keep the editor open while modifying the level, each time the level reboots (ie. the Reaper dies) the game will load the file completely and all the changes that have been done are immediately present. With this you can get into a quick rhythm of experimenting with what works and what needs adjustment and then right away go about your way of making those updates before there&#39;s a slightest chance of you forgetting them.

Sometimes a layout just won&#39;t turn around to an enjoyable experience. There&#39;s no need to get into a deadlock with it. Take what parts you found interesting or worked and start anew from scratch. It&#39;s always an option even if a bit imitating. If you have a general architecture in mind, you might find out that putting it together it in the editor might be a relatively short task.

If your level is meant to have special editor functions that aren&#39;t accessible through the editor and have to be manually added, you might want to add those in the very last minute rather earlier on and use placeholder items that imitate the purpose of those special assets until then. Once you&#39;ve elements in your level that makes it impossible to edit the level with the editor, it can really bog down the progression of the level&#39;s development as repeatedly editing the stage with some text editor manually can be quite tedious. If you want an easy time creating a level, it&#39;s advised not to use these special editor functions. They are very much optional and you shouldn&#39;t feel it&#39;s necessary to have them.

# 7.Checklist of Level Evaluation

When working on traditional Deadbolt levels you can arguably create a checklist of sorts which can be used to evaluate whether the level might be missing too many elements to make it a varied experience – or whether it has too much going on and the focus is all over the place. Obviously, this kind of oversimplified approach isn&#39;t always on point and has to be understood contextually as it can&#39;t always be applied properly.

- Is the story **premise** clear? Does it set the context and a goal for the player? A map doesn&#39;t necessarily need to have a story at all if the player has at least a vague idea as to what they are doing. Then again, there&#39;s no limit how much a story can enhance the play experience.
- Do the mission **objectives** make sense story wise? Do they give a good sense of progression? How well they transition from one to another? Can they incentivize the player mechanically beyond having to be completed in order to finish the level?
- Can the level&#39;s look and **layout** grab the player&#39;s interest? Is navigation throughout the level an interesting challenge in itself?
- Is the level **linear**? Are the different parts of the map segmented and compartmentalized? Is it horizontally or vertically focused? Why?
- If the level has **choreographed** sequences, how likely is the player naturally going to stumble upon them? Are they loose or very strict, puzzle-like challenges? Does the level provide an alternative way to circumvent them?
- How **open-ended** is the level? Does it have a sandbox-esque nature? How **interconnected** is it?
- Is the player provided with number of various approaches? Are there numerous (varied) weaponry provided relatively early on? Are mixes of stealthy and aggressive playstyles possible? How creative are the stealth set-ups?
- How many different types of enemies are present? Is the variance required? Restricting the type of enemy factions can create a more cohesive experience.
- Are there **enemy reinforcements** or spawns? Are they telegraphed well enough or does the player have enough time to react to them? In case of enemy backup, where are they likely to travel? How likely are they going to get stuck somewhere and pile up? Finally, are they necessary to the experience as a whole? Do they feel like a good note to end the level on?
- Given it&#39;s intended for the player to take down most of the enemies in the map, Is there enough ammunition / **weaponry** in the level? Personally, I balance all my levels with the default &quot;revolver only&quot; loadout and work my way up there. This obviously excludes levels where the all the player&#39;s weapons are taken away by default at the start.
- How does the **lighting** look? Have you utilized it with reservation and care (they are the most resource intensive objects)? Do they provide interesting gameplay scenarios?
- Is there any **piping** in the level? Are the paths they provide roughly balanced or are some of them blatantly more advantageous? Vents are a good way to cut out backtracking from the end of a level. They can also provide a multi-angled attack approach for the player (run and gun) and greatly help navigating even extremely spacious maps. However, having vents all over can also trivialize gameplay in the sense that the player never really needs to dedicate to any course of action or location and have a free out of jail card with every vent if things start going haywire.
- How many, if any, **traps** are there in the level? How &quot;fair&quot; are they considering their expected time of encounter (how punished is the player at that moment if they fail to note them)? Do they enable interesting gameplay scenarios? Remember that traps are resource intensive as well and hence you should always double-check each whether it&#39;s necessary to have.
- How are **navigational transitions points** handled? Are there for example drop-off points on higher levels (ledges)? Are some of the doors locked? Is there a mechanical reason for them to be locked? Having doors locked with no apparent reason adds up quickly tedious padding to each run. Similarly, swinging doors cut out one door opening click (&#39;E&#39;) out of each run. A normal door has more mechanical depth though (knocking). However, that main function can also be implemented using microwaves. Alternatively, easy to forget tools are windows (walls), that provide another transition point and open lines of sight.
- Does the **music** fit the ambient feel of the level? Have you remembered to place music items in the rooms?

# 8.Self-Assessing My Levels

This is self-evaluating exercise in where I also practise using the vocabulary defined in the glossary.

## 8.1.Synthesize the Soul

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1441913281](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1441913281)

Design keywords: [open-ended](#_Open-ended), [central hub](#_Central_hub), [set piece](#_Set_Piece)

This is a rework of my original first level, which is still accessible for those interested and ended up being quite popular. My main issues with the level was mainly the size, which drags down the frame rate on lower powered PCs (such as mine) and it being slightly too expansive in any case. Especially the lower left of the level below the elevator with a Lich and all seemed a bit too much and nonrelated. The level also ended up being quite of a time sink while certainly providing the player with an engaging mission concept that I later revisited with my &quot;Blood and Tonic&quot; map.

Regardless, the level that I resubmitted after my return to the Deadbolt custom design, was the rework that first started my played with my experiences relating to creating multi-dimensional map with branching paths and maximum player choice. This is the quintessential _central hub_ design, where the starting opening sections presents the player with multiple places to go in addition to the venting close by. The layout is that of an arch, where the level has two rising pillars both on left and right. In addition to these there are these lowest level &quot;side quest&quot; like sections with some minor things of interest for the player to explore.

The central secret small room hosts the location of Bartender bottle that the players must take out to be able to kill the Bartender. There&#39;s also subtly hidden bartender bottle on the left-top side of the map that is linked to the Bartender that comes as a backup.

The top half of the level, the actual large dance stage room is the level&#39;s _set piece_ that has notably beautiful lighting and possibility of stealth sequences. It&#39;s very much reminiscent of those presented in movies such as John Wick and is clearly hoping to invoke them. Hopefully players find it a pleasing area both visually and mechanically.

The level&#39;s name is meant to refence the vampire fascination with ash statues which is also being referred in the description. My recollection of this was that It was also here alluding that the phylacteries of the Bartenders are in some part made of this substance which is the reason those statues are being so revered.

What I think I would update here is the last &quot;kill all undead&quot; mission that has a low note ending as you are tasked to take out all the dancers. In here, couple of few assassination markers in addition to &quot;kill backup&quot; objective would likely give a much more satisfying and compact experience.

## 8.2.Quite A Headful

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1441767678](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1441767678)

Design keywords: [set piece](#_Set_Piece), [central hub](#_Central_hub)

Following that remake I went on playing further on the concepts of central hub and set piece. Here, they are close to being the same thing, as the main focus of the level is the room with all the windows and Shamblers heads. Unlike the &quot;Synthesize the Soul&quot;, which is shaped as an Arch, this goes a step further and is instead drawn out as an encompassing circle for the central area.

That center room plays as the main antagonist of the level as it is well lit and guarded by a considerable number of Shamblers. This is why the level is set up to have a number of advantage points to take out those Shambler heads outside of that room through windows.

The level&#39;s thematical premise and a gimmick in a sense is that of an underground lair, which I don&#39;t recall being explored that much in the campaign. Immediately after entering the house, the player is presented with branching paths to handle the Shambler close to the Zombie Camera enemy. Playing further into this secret lair idea, the map hosts number of Cerberuses to keep the player on their toes and invoke the feeling of entering a guarded dungeon. Zombie Cameras are similarly used for this purpose.

Later on, I added the upper right-route which leads the players to the right-bottom side of the map – providing the player with yet another angle of attack and choice.

This level was also probably my first case of exploring the concept of surreal architecture that I think is an important concept to understand in the face of overwhelming exclusivity of the &quot;boxes cut with a line or two.&quot;

Challenge rating of the enemies in the map is relatively low, the two [Rolands](#_Roland) being the toughest around.

Perhaps one thing I could see doing here is having backup enemies come after the players once they have managed to gather the information from the safe, but it doesn&#39;t necessary add much to the stag. In fact, it might be more of an annoyance if the player spent a considerable amount of time exploring to meticulously take out the Shambler heads on the central room.

## 8.3.Blind As A Bat

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1765315754](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1765315754)

Design keywords: [dynamic duo](#_Dynamic_duo_2), [gimmick](#_Segmented), [Punk](#_Punk), [open-ended](#_Open-ended)

This is a _dynamic duo_ map with a _gimmick_. The duo here being Nightcrawlers and Punks. Gimmick is the fact we technically have a new type of enemy here in the form of Punks that are upside down on the ceiling.

This akin to how Incubi and Succubi do it, but Punks in the ceiling can&#39;t jump down to reverse their gravity back to &quot;normal.&quot; There&#39;s also a visual bug where when they shoot their arm / weapons appears above them as if they were not reversed vertically. This doesn&#39;t seem to have any gameplay implications however though so it&#39;s surprisingly natural to use them in this manner. There are quirks in the level&#39;s layout related to them obviously, such as doubly layered doors that open both from the top and bottom of the room, but those I find mere technical peculiarities that in my opinion don&#39;t play a particularly relevant level design role to the players themselves.

Thematically this duo plays so that the Nightcrawler are, well bats, where as the Punks are the &quot;blind bats&quot; referred to in the title, which I think is a cute twist. The look of the setting is that of a &quot;bat den&quot; with most of the stuff being upside down like the Punks themselves. Story wise, I imagined that the Nightcrawlers are training the Punks to be more bat-like, or that they have been tasked to take care of this mutated zombie colony.

Another notably little visual touch that works of the theme is that the whole structure of two connected houses is hanging upside down.

The rooms are just low enough that if you pass through a Punk even in darkness, it will become alerted and start shooting you. The level is badly lit, making the Punks less of a danger, so it&#39;s reasonable to have a considerable amount of them littered around. This is a concept I already had explored with my &quot;Heads On Prices&quot; level and is the map that I find most reminiscent of this.

Regardless, this is where the Nightcrawlers come in as they have no trouble seeing in the dark. The suppressed PDW that the Nightcrawlers drop is a perfect weapon to take out the Punks on the ceilings (somewhat similar to &quot;Heads On Prices&quot; again and how Suppressed 9mm was utilized there). The pair plays well together, where the Punks could be considered akin to an environmental hazard (in that they are specifically situational in their effectiveness as enemies) and as a back-up support for the Nightcrawlers when they start raising alerted statuses.

The way the artificial intelligence works is that you start mentally mapping the level in terms of Nightcrawlers as they are the main source of additional weaponry and clearly the most perceptive enemy that can notice you in the complete dark from far distances. However, while the Punks are much more limited in their range and perception, they can still do play a considerable role and surprisingly easily take you out if you don&#39;t keep them in mind – especially with the support of Nightcrawlers that when notice you do also warn the Punks to be ready as mentioned before.

The unique set-up of having the Nightcrawlers be the only enemies to travel on the ground, while everything else is attached to ceiling, makes the traditionally very powerful melee weapons quite a bit weaker here. This is why I felt like the level could afford to have a number of knives littered around as they would mainly be used as a silent throwing weapon more so and aren&#39;t particularly effective against Nightcrawlers in melee. Obviously, they are still better than going at it with fists alone though.

While the level is mainly focused around the duo of Nightcrawler and Punks, it also hosts a small number of other enemy types as disruptive elements and to give additional flavour to few specific sections of the map. The single Incubus is a notable peculiarity here – the main reason it&#39;s there is that it&#39;s an enemy unit tall enough to work as a meat shield for the Shambler head next to it. It being the only enemy on the ceiling in this level that can drop from that ceiling can also be an interesting comparison point next to the more static Punks.

There are a couple of active Shamblers in the level as well, that provide these suitable spraying weapons to take out Punks while also being considerable loud and hence attracting Nightcrawlers. Shambler heads and bodies being located close the ceiling is a twist interestingly similar to the Punks themselves. Like their other zombie counterpart, the Shambler heads are at a disadvantage with the low lighting of the level. This is why they are supported slightly by having there be a number of &quot;decoy&quot; Shambler heads that aren&#39;t attached to any Shambler body.

The level has extensive piping that I think I managed there to have multiple similarly viable routes which gives players the freedom of choice and additional flexibility to their approach. This is expected to give the map more of a relaxed feel where you can try out various approaches as well as replayability. There are a few sneak bits of stealth available as well where you can for example get the Blunderbuss without having to kill a single enemy.

As far as the level&#39;s internal structure goes by my standards, this has a very traditional layout that is more accentuated by its thematical look rather than any abnormal architecture. Granted, doorways that are essentially one-way in the sense they drop you off from the top of the ceiling is a cute twist but have only middling gameplay impact.

Perhaps one of the biggest potential issues with the level is that player can run out of ammo. However, the amount of weaponry with high bullet capacity – SMGs from Shamblers and PWDs from Nightcrawler – lessen the possibility of this issue. Obviously, if the player would enter a game state where they have killed all the Nightcrawlers but have run out of ammunition to take out the Punks - it would be a rather disappointing defeat and would force them to manually restart.

The level uses a very traditional &quot;kill all enemies&quot; objective that forces one to actively deal with both the Nightcrawlers and the Punks. I could see here going for marking only the Punks for assassination but given their numbers and how much of a role Nightcrawlers play in terms of ammunition and such, it would seem more like a distraction to hint that the player could try to avoid the Nightcrawlers instead of killing them.

Also, I would imagine there would be quite a number of red arrows all over the place – and in ceilings of all places. Like it was mentioned before, the level essentially provides you with a new enemy type to play with and doesn&#39;t really need any further distractions beyond that premise to make it an engaging experience (which could in fact also just end up making the level worse).

## 8.4.Even Death May Die

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1609686290](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1609686290)

Design keywords: [choreographed](#_Choreographed_1), [challenge run](#_Challenge_run_1), [linear](#_Linearity_1), [action](#_Action), [preliminary loadout](#_Preliminary_loadout)

Currently my most action-oriented map, this is a [_linear_](#_Linearity_1)[_challenge run_](#_Challenge_run_1) with descending difficulty and a surprisingly [_choreographed_](#_Choreographed_1) action sequence in the second room. In the first room, the emphasis is very much on testing the player&#39;s reaction speed and accuracy.

Given this (literally) explosive start, it was my first level that forced me to implement the concept of having the player choose their loadout in a [pre-level style of weapon selection](#_Preliminary_loadout).

The initial room can obviously be frustrating if you don&#39;t have the right mental outset as you are extremely fast smashed right back into the situation. The loop here is short to say the least, and with enough practise you can overcome the room reasonably consistently even if it initially may seem completely out of your hands to do that.

There&#39;s a little side show on the far-left here with explosives and motel sign getting broken that can play out in various ways and adds additional action flare to the shootout.

The intensity of the first room is why I decided to have a descending difficulty – well, in some parts at least though each of the challenges are notably different so they don&#39;t compare that cleanly with each other. This is also where I gave the player some breathing room and time to assess their situation such as ammunition count before needing to move forward.

Second room is all about cover and finding the right place to move to as the fight progresses. Akin to the first room, the intent is to create a hair-raising scenario – that is what the flashing red light, messed up vampire decorations as well as the very real vampires getting blown to bits with the explosives is hoping to invoke.

There&#39;s a &quot;do it&quot; markings indicating what table you should take cover behind though admittedly it&#39;s easy the miss. While you might be able to survive on the other spots, this is the most guaranteed place where you are not to get killed by the Succubi and what not that may activate during the unfolding scenario.

As the Patriarchs notice you off the distance and start shooting through the crowd the following scene is that off absolutely mayhem as there are hanging grenades around that are wired to trigger in this onslaught of bullets. The explosions are also set up in a way that they are unlikely to straight-up kill all the dancers, but rather some of them may become activated and aggressive. This is where the player is expected to use the PWD to take out the stragglers even in the middle of Patriarch attack.

After that the it&#39;s likely that a Bouncer may activate at this point and it&#39;s recommended to move back to the cover behind you as there are likely still dancing Incubi between you and the Bouncer. At some point in here, a Punk may become activated as well, which may prompt you to move even further back to the small table closer the entrance of this room as the Punk&#39;s shooting range is greater than that of a Bouncer.

With the Bouncer and Punk gone, you can go grab the sawed-off shotgun and dance around with the Patriarchs to take them out.

I obviously assume that this isn&#39;t the only effective way to clear out the room, but it is the intended one and it at least to me felt fairly natural sequence of events to pull off even if when there are some variation involved – such as the Punk not beginning alerted or so. Sadly, it&#39;s hard to say how well the room manages to tunnel the player into this experience. The thing I found most interesting here how such a seemingly chaotic action scenario could be made to play in this very choreographed manner.

I do recall that the inspiration for this room game from the idea of emulating a rock-stage kind of crowd setting where the Reaper is taking cover among the dancing vampires while the Patriarch, acting the role of a rock-star, is going off on the far-distance through the Vampire mass. A very visceral scene with both immense visual and audio pressure placed upon the player.

Moving forward to the third and last section, you are provided with a minor quip from the enemies as they seemingly haven&#39;t been able to notice the chaos that has unfolded which plays in contrast in its levity to the high-intensity action the player was dragged through. Gameplay wise the following is standard fare where you are provided with a SMG and the main point to realize is to take out the light outside as soon as you exit the elevator before mowing down the enemies.

Since the last two obstacles had a lot of anxiety to them, here I wanted to alleviate some of that build up and provide a reasonably manageable and predictable enemy layout right before the end. The elevator acts as a separator of the two rooms, the literal representation to the exit of the stage, and as a calming element before the final push when it finally arrives at the top and open its doors.

The last bit is a sneaky little touch where a Punk is spawned close the edge of the screen below the balcony, close to the exit. It&#39;s essentially used as a jab at the player if they somehow became too relaxed at this point and fail to notice it.

There are some contrasting story elements involved with the case file and description here. The rhyme of the fireplace is brash and bold, declaring death to all and any resistors. However, the case file&#39;s description is just the word &quot;SURVIVE.&quot; This is to hint towards fireplaces growing complacency towards the Reaper being an invincible force that just can&#39;t fail and throwing him carelessly even against insanely dangerous situation.

The level&#39;s title is also a hint towards this, as it suggests of Reaper&#39;s vulnerability even as a force of death. Indeed, the player is quite unlikely to pull through the first room without a single death - especially on their first try - but is rather smashed towards the enemy force like a blunt object… this also being indicated is happening meta-story level from fireplace&#39;s perspective.

As a challenge run this is quite short, but it is compounded by the high sensory output and intensity the player is bombarded with. In this sense, some of the challenge comes from just being able to keep focused head even in the face of overwhelming mayhem.

Granted, this is a rather experimental map that combines a variety of themes – both mechanical and flavour - that players certainly haven&#39;t been subjected to through vanilla Deadbolt. So, I would assume it has a reasonable high ranking in terms of generating controversy and being divisive. That is, being something that the players who enjoy it really enjoy it, while the people disliking it really dislike it. Given the lack of feedback this is purely speculative though.

## 8.5.Cold Embrace

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1761469883](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1761469883)

Design keywords: [weapon highlight](#_Weapon_highlight_1), [open-ended](#_Open-ended), [surreal architecture](#_Surreal_Architecture)

The gimmick of this level is to take full advantage of a weapon that isn&#39;t used in the official campaign, nor is available in other versions of the game. That is the Lich Arm, a unique weapon with numerous interesting qualities exclusive to it. From what I&#39;ve heard, after having it fully implemented, the developers deemed the weapon too boring to use, which I have to say I find surprising to hear, but I guess it relates to it requiring slightly different type of level design to really shine. This level is attempting to showcase that.

The shape of the level is that of an arc where the player&#39;s starting position is located at the top and provides them with numerous routes to explore. The bottom-middle part of the map is a large, multi-tiered central hub divided by balconies. Each side of the map, west and east respectively, have additional weaponry that encourage the player to explore them.

The level utilizes a lot of glass walls, mainly because it encourages using the Lich arm and secondly because it helps to open up the level from the sides providing even more openings to enter. Being a completely silent weapon – and only one weapon that doesn&#39;t leave the types of corpses Liches are attracted to – the enemy layouts are done so that they enable stealth sequences.

There&#39;s a central quest of taking out the enemies with phylacteries, here there being two - Bartender being the sub-boss along with Roland I guess - and Madame Stela being the main &quot;hidden antagonist&quot; so to speak with three different phylacteries. This is a very simple implementation of the reliable _phylactery hunt_ motivational goal and doesn&#39;t need much explanation here.

As explained in the &quot;hints &amp; tips&quot; section of this level&#39;s workshop page, the levels main mechanical core is ammunition conservation in the form of route optimization and picking what enemy to use what weapon on. The open-endedness of the level (albeit it&#39;s heavily encouraged to get the Lich Arm right at the beginning in most runs) makes it viable for experimentation when it comes to seeking different ways to complete the level, here being particularly focused on the weapon pick-up order.

The level&#39;s title is clear a reference and hint to the Liches and the focus on the Lich Arm weapon itself. With that it&#39;s also easy to associate the clean white, freezer looking central hub with the presence of snow and snowfall along the freezing theme the level&#39;s name implies.

One thing I could have perhaps played more with is having various ash vampires as decorations to play along with the ones you are likely going to ashify yourself. I think the main thing deterring me from that - though it&#39;s also arguable whether it adds or detracts from the level – is that vampire ash statues are surprisingly resource intensive which I assume comes from them having minor animation loops associated.

This managed to become the Map of the Week #47, and the article has its own take on the level:

## 8.6.Image Of A Shadow

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1574691008](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1574691008)

Design keywords: [choreographed](#_Choreographed_1), [stealth](#_Stealth), [puzzle](#_Puzzle_1)

This level features two highly choreographed, alternative stealth routes. The setting itself is set-up as a sandbox of sorts which does enable at least one very subtle third fast route towards the goal of the map. This I see as a surplus that rewards creativity in a very natural way and was something that I kind of intended as I also did set up various other elements in the map – the elevator and electric box for example on the left side of the map – that players maybe able to find some usage for even if I haven&#39;t specifically playtested for scenarios involving for those. In addition to these, there is also the obvious brute-force killing rampage method that provides a harsh - but not impossible - challenge for those not interested in the stealth-puzzle the level is selling.

The two intended routes through the level are meticulous to say the least and I have a hard time predicting how well players might be able to decipher them. I do find them engaging to pull of through in any case, and I hope that discovering them through natural progression would be very enjoyable.

The top route of the map is focused on playing around with the way how Nightcrawler&#39;s see clearly even in total darkness. It features a lot of trailing and moving among the enemies. The level pushes for an enclosed feeling as it has plenty of rooms where the vampires on the ceiling just barely can&#39;t see you.

The bottom one is more oriented towards Shamblers and how taking out their heads doesn&#39;t raise any alarms for the enemies who witness the aftermath of a Shambler&#39;s head that has been taken out. The Shambler&#39;s dead body itself will however make enemies suspicious.

The main objective is the level is to get to the information box located on the top-right small room of the house – ironically right under the Reaper&#39;s starting location. After the player is expected to climb back to the car or exit through the left-side of the map.

Even with all the enemies all over, I do recall there being the viability of a pacifist run where you don&#39;t need to kill a single enemy. There it seems like it would be the Shambler head with the locked information box that would be the most problematic enemy to avoid killing.

I find the level&#39;s title a bit bland here in that it&#39;s rather generic and not that interwoven with the level&#39;s mechanic or theme in any novel way aside from it being for a stealth-oriented map.

This level also features a sneaky little trap in the locked room, where a player might be inclined to accidentally click the microwave instead of interacting with the safe next to it. The realization of how you just got played in that discreet manner can be quite of an experience. It certainly was even for me when I came back to the level to record an example playthrough and stared at the screen for a second or two after hearing the microwave sound go off, before straight-up screaming &quot;No&quot; and laughing as I realized it was all already over as the Nightcrawler&#39;s attention was now geared towards entering that room and there being no way of getting that box unlocked fast enough.

So, is it a good map? Well, maybe. It&#39;s strict in certain sense and open in another. I could see these types of levels having a following and I think it certainly succeeds in providing an alternative gameplay experience that is much more brash in being stealth-oriented rather than providing light stealth-action hybrid experiences.

## 8.7.No Morning In Sight

Design keywords: [story](#_Story), [linear](#_Linearity_1), [other](#_Other), [segmented](#_Segmented_1), [puzzle](#_Puzzle_1), [event-driven](#_Platformer)

This is most likely my biggest departure from the usual Deadbolt gameplay experience. The Reaper is placed in the role of detective - tasked to look or clues for a case of sudden ashification of an Incubus. The map is a heavily scripted, linear story sequence with one &quot;scene&quot; leading to another. It has light puzzle elements and numerous fiendish traps.

This is not a level trying to utilize the stealth-action hybrid gameplay that Deadbolt was originally made for, but rather an experimentation in utilizing the editor&#39;s scripting capabilities to create something akin to a roleplaying session in the sense that it&#39;s focused on asking the player digest the dialog&#39;s hints and keeping a keen attention on the environment.

The traps are quite devious, and this is where the level is seeking emulating the classic type of perception checks of roleplaying games and tasking the player to stay extremely suspicious of the events unfolding before them. This is playing into theme of the detective work where you are deciphering what is going on, where you should go next, and why. There are no clear arrows towards any of the objectives which leaves you with the task of figuring out how to proceed.

Given this almost comic strip like premise, the level has limited replayability and is completable in few minutes once you know the right sequence. After the player has gone through the whole level, I see the level&#39;s lasting value coming from the story presented through the cutscenes and the feeling it&#39;s looking to invoke.

The level&#39;s dialog is entrenched in melancholic, sardonicistic self-reflection that is common for the Noir genre that the level is playing off with its detective theme mechanically as well.

This is a map where I ended up doing considerable amount of rework to make it more stream-lined among other things as I got a reasonable amount of feedback on it – seemingly because I specifically highlighted it as a story-oriented experience though it seems people were quite taken aback from the direct departure from Deadbolt&#39;s standard gameplay experience. This is where I also added additional optional cutscenes to certain spots that give additional hints about certain sections and phases of the level. I also ended up making some of the more devious traps a bit more discernible.

The level is certainly an interesting piece of work as it provides an experience that one would be hard-pressed to find in traditional Deadbolt levels. However, this no doubt becomes with the package of fighting against the grain as it can seemingly come out of left field as a harsh contrast for players now well used to the stealth-action loops the game&#39;s mechanics have been almost exclusively used for.

From technical perspective, I think the main issue with this kind of level is the extent that it requires the designer to work with editor capabilities that aren&#39;t even officially part of it. Examples of these including keycard destruction triggers and despawning. Even ignoring those considerations, these kinds of scripted sequences require a high count of triggers which can easily end up overwhelming the designer as they are trying to keep track of each of them.

With all of that in mind, I find the main question to be whether it&#39;s worth spending all of that effort to create this type of experience when you could in all likelihood be able to spent that same amount of effort to create multiple, much more traditional, type of levels instead. Regardless, given the right crowd, I could certainly see the appeal for this kind of a deal.

As a design exercise the level is at least exceedingly interesting – taking a notably risky approach that places it in direct opposition against how we may might think (perhaps subconsciously) a level of Deadbolt should and shouldn&#39;t play like.

## 8.8.Cup Runneth Over

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1663738761](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1663738761)

Design keywords: [segmented](#_Segmented_1), [open-ended](#_Open-ended), [conventional](#_Conventional,_traditional,_mundane)?

This was made in the spur of a moment, within hour or two if I recall correctly. It&#39;s a segmented, open-ended level with roughly three separate areas. It starts the Reaper in a somewhat peculiar place where they are next to a ladder and falling.

The start section supports some neat melee juggling with Sergeants using their sledgehammers. There is a subtle Sergeant death triggers that kills a Punk on the right-side of the map. The intent here is to prevent the player from being able to clear that right-side of the map with little effort once they&#39;ve gained access to the sledgehammer. The Punk&#39;s death alerts the enemies on that section of the map, starting to pace around, making them much less susceptible to silent take downs with a sledgehammer.

There are multiple ways to tackle the starting section and the very beginning provides an alternative approach if you&#39;re able to grab on the ladder, which can be surprisingly difficult. You can also fully ignore this area you&#39;re dropped off to and move directly to one of the other two sections if you wish so as there are vents provided close to the beginning. While having some fancy looking structuring, the perhaps the least noteworthy area of the map is the third top area on the right.

Once the basic main &quot;kill all enemies&quot; objective has been completed, there&#39;s a delayed use trigger linked to Reaper&#39;s car that ends the level without having to worry about how to reach it.

I personally find this to be well put together, concise map with some slightly unusual architecture that gives It character. In a similar manner, there isn&#39;t much to be said with the level&#39;s title that has nice flare to it, but only in passing might refer to the level being located in docks setting.

## 8.9.Show Who&#39;s Boss

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1608032774](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1608032774)

Design keywords: [boss rush](#_Boss_battle,_boss), [open-ended](#_Open-ended), [segmented](#_Segmented_1)

An expansive level with numerous boss enemies, including the infamous final boss himself, this is a level that is essentially an open-ended boss rush. The idea is to get down the feeling of a large mansion with the different parts each feeling distinct from each other. It&#39;s a very sand box-ish type of level layout where you can spend a considerable amount of time exploring the nooks and crannies of the place in search of weapons and just alternative approaches to the level.

Especially the higher floors with the motel like composition connected to the stone-wall top section provide a lot of room for experimentation gameplay wise – in terms of different approaches, weapon pick-up order, and stealth routines.

The level is quite spacious with large rooms which might be something worth of note if you know my preference on the subject.

An unfortunately annoying feature is associated with the innate scripting of Amber and Evelyn where killing them triggers cutscenes that can easily get your killed if you aren&#39;t able to skip them fast enough. There isn&#39;t much to be done about this though aside from just deleting them from the level and I don&#39;t find this _enough_ of an issue albeit it is _an_ issue.

These is a notable peculiarity regarding the objective, where while the task is to kill all enemies, Ibzan has innate scripting associated with him – no doubt related to his respawning nature – that will complete that main objective when in fact you might have only killed Ibzan himself. Now, as far as playing the level casually, Ibzan is a high candidate to be the enemy you would tackle last and gather weapons all around before engaging actively with him, so this doesn&#39;t necessarily affect that playthrough that much. It can certainly add some spice to the hypothetical speedruns people might attempt for this level that I&#39;m not actively against. So, all in all, I find it acceptable, even if it could technically be qualified as a bug.

In any case, the level has a nice look to it backed up it playing nicely as well. The boss enemies, including Ibzan, feel at home here.

The level&#39;s title implies to the nature of the stage being this boss rush-y kind of thing.

## 8.10.Lay Waste And Low

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1447769298](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1447769298)

Design keywords: [action](#_Action), [open-ended](#_Open-ended), horizontal

This level has a quite ambitious goal that it in my opinion succeeds surprisingly well in pulling off. The main thrust of the level is the emulate the chaotic feeling of a warzone or a turf zone war. The level literally starts with a bang, having these seemingly random trap sets that the patrolling enemies will end up triggering if left to their own devices.

One thing to note here is that when it comes to creating layouts with heavy emphasizes on representing a single faction, demons are the ones that I personally find hardest to design for so in that sense this remains somewhat of an anomaly in my workshop. As far as I can tell, demons are the ones with the least mechanical definition to them, where there is almost nothing unique to them aside from the Patriarch being this burly dude with a cumbersome and explosive attack. Cardinal is bog standard melee enemy. Maiden likely has the longest range of any enemy unit and is quite deadly. Still, this pales in comparison the depth of mechanics gravity defying vampires with Bartenders have – or that of expressive Punks and all the Shambler shenanigans you can concoct – or the Dredgedwith the resurrecting Liches and the ability to be burrowed in the ground.

The look of the level is that of a barren and demolished neighbourhood. It is lit by a crimson light far above the screen which gives a nice ambient feel to the whole thing. Manoeuvring your way through the &quot;battle-zone&quot; to the various cover objects and advantage points of the level can be very enjoyable. There are various &quot;sprints&quot; available that give you access to different weaponry.

The level also features a pseudo-hidden Grenade launcher on the far-right in a candle prison of sorts that plays thematically well enough.

I usually find Technicians to be source of lot of trouble and certainly there is potential for some of that here as well – especially as the level can end up in scenarios where an alerted Sergeant is left planting its mines for crash inducingly long – but its capricious explosive nature plays extremely well into the setting, and the general horizontality of the level helps to alleviate the common problems that come from utilizing the enemy type. Notably, even with all of these justifications, I would still be wary about having many of them, and the level as is currently only has exactly one of them.

The main objective is to take out the main three Patriarchs but is followed by a back-up killing objective. The aforementioned horizontality of the level works well with enemy backup as you usually given a considerable amount of time to assess your options given you haven&#39;t ended up being on either of the very far-sides of the map when you complete the first objective. There might be some inconsistency when it comes to the game properly checking the back-ups as being targets you need to take out, but this isn&#39;t part that I&#39;m too worried about as they will likely remain a challenge whether they are specifically marked as targets that you need to kill or not.

This is certainly a setting that I&#39;ve thought about revisiting thematically at the very least since it&#39;s quite evocative. Getting this type of level to play in an enjoyable manner might become an exercise in frustration though even if in this particular instance it ended up all well.

## 8.11.Living On A Wire

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1445320838](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1445320838)

Design keywords[: surreal architecture](#_Surreal_architecture,_nonconvention), [open-ended](#_Open-ended)

In this level I really went with the surreal architecture concept, which made the level very freeform with bunch of floating rooms and such. Regardless of its peculiar shapes, the enemies surprisingly aren&#39;t rendered useless which really speaks to just how wild you can with level layout before it starts clashing with the enemies pathing and such. I see much of the gameplay experience for the level being exploring the strange pathways the level offers.

Different types of enemies are utilized well here while still sticking only to two different groups of undead, which keeps it cohesive.

The architecture enables various interesting little scenarios. For example, right at the beginning we have the Cerberus plus Nightcrawler patrol on the right with hidden Grunt next to the shotgun on the left. It&#39;s a surprisingly tight scene with all the enemies being on slightly different elevations with windows used to keep it open. Notably the lights on the map have been placed very precisely to make it possibly for these desirable scenarios to unfold.

Player&#39;s goal and direction is guided by extensive piping where the pipe blocks act as unofficial objectives against player&#39;s progression. I recall at the time thinking about various options that could force the player explore the points of the map I wanted. As opposed to placing ash drugs or whatever on the level as objective item you would need to touch, this felt a much more natural way as they also open the map up to the player – having a functional purpose that helps the player in achieving their goal indirectly rather than explicitly and artificially. Entering these pipes provides a clear sense of where you should go next which is good.

Somewhat disappointingly, with the description, title, and the objective being killing Timur, they are rather loosely tied to the level mechanically speaking. There are few traps to speaks of. The final part features a challenge in the vein of the official Timur map - so It does at least explain the level&#39;s title in some capacity. It&#39;s what looks to be a pick-a-door type of challenge, but there are actually multiple ways to complete it in a way that isn&#39;t just guesswork.

## 8.12.Drop Deadly

Design keywords: [linear](#_Linearity_1), [segmented](#_Segmented_1), [challenge run](#_Challenge_run_1), [time-sensitive](#_Time-sensitive)

This is a direct spiritual successor to the official Timur level. It&#39;s a straight-forward, segmented challenge run with a time limit.

As my first linear, segmented Deadbolt custom map, this is where I first used the design practice of playtesting and implementing every single segment in isolation before chaining them together for the final project. It is a tight experience where much consideration was placed on the order of the challenges, its pacing, and how the level of difficulty develops during its course.

The look of the level is that of a single long trailer. This works perfectly for this type of linear and segmented map. The level starts by placing the player in a capricious situation on top of a trailer which is wired to blow.

The following trailers until the elevator are a bit more complicated matter to resolve properly and requires the player switching sides and disabling traps in a very controlled manner. There&#39;s a rather cheapish attack by Cerberuses in the middle of it, but given how early in the stage it is, I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s particularly offensive. The issue could be alleviated by adding additional warning signs that the Cerberuses are about to spawn and might be something I&#39;ll look into in the future.

The line to the end is a sequence of a nasty collection of traps of various kinds with ascending level of difficulty to disable them properly.

The main objective of the level are the skeleton totems which are tied to the harvest. They also happen to fit the level&#39;s look nicely (strange cargo inside a train) and give it a nice feeling.

Most certainly the trick, where the player can evade the harvest by hiding inside a vent, should be circumvented here. This was proven to be possible in &quot;Deathbed Conversion&quot; where it does feature such a &quot;security measure.&quot; So, we know it&#39;s possible to do and there&#39;s little reason not to rectify it eventually.

The level&#39;s title was something I wasn&#39;t never too pleased with. There&#39;s strange reference to it by having a dead Succubus drop on the street from player&#39;s left. It can also be seen describing the initial set-up where the player has to make the grenades drop and then lower themselves to the first train cart from its roof. Regardless, these are connections are rather flimsy and the name does relatively little to describe the level beyond those few things in the beginning.

## 8.13.Ghost Recon

Design keywords: [puzzle](#_Puzzle), [linear](#_Linearity_1), [challenge run](#_Challenge_run_1), [segmented](#_Segmented_1), tutorial-esque, ascending difficulty

This is an anomaly to say the least. It explores a very convoluted [_gimmick_](#_Gimmick) – both mentally and technically – where it places the Reaper in a setting where they can&#39;t directly see their enemies – and are upside as well. As far as the layout goes, it&#39;s another [segmented](#_Segmented), [linear](#_Linearity)[challenge run](#_Challenge_Run) with ascending level of difficulty. It&#39;s a puzzle level disguised as a stealth-oriented one.

The level utilizes extremely traditional tutorial-like progression that attempts to hand-held the player through it. This is done in hopes to off-set the absolute wackiness of the premise.

The level was quite painstaking to put together as it requires creating a replicate world below the player&#39;s line of sight. There are a lot of technicalities involved with its design, those being mainly related to there actually being two Reaper objects in the level.

Additional feedback could be given to the player by despawning the ash statues when its corresponding vampire is killed. Right now, it can become somewhat questionable at times whether you&#39;ve already killed the vampire you were targeting or not.

While the level is certainly a nice change of pace, being almost entirely action free, I don&#39;t think the design space is particularly vast here. I would imagine I would be hard-pressed to create an additional level or two of equal quality with this gimmick that would still provide something new for the players to experience. Now, you don&#39;t always have to innovate, but with this mechanic, I don&#39;t see it faring that well with repetition. Perhaps one place I could see transitioning this idea into would be a bit less [_linear_](#_Linearity) level.

Design keywords: [open-ended](#_Open-ended), [set piece](#_Set_Piece), [surreal architecture](#_Surreal_Architecture)

Main drive for this level was a thematical one. I wanted to create a setting that looked and felt like a factory.

The [_set piece_](#_Set_Piece)of the level is the central assembly line hall, which sets the main mood for the level. It is enwrapped with this office top line and an elevator rise. Another point of interest seems to be the generator room on top-right, next to the office, with numerous ash caches inside it.

The [_segmentation_](#_Segmented) of the map is quite something, where it&#39;s both tightly packed and loose at the same time. The different parts of the map are very pronounced in the way they differ from each other. There&#39;s a lot of detail with all the rooms, each featuring little something unique to their own.

Despite all of this, the layout is an [_open-ended_](#_Open-Endedness)one and there are many ways to navigate through it. The level does enable some beautiful non-explicit stealth sequences players can experience if they get into it.

The piping system in the level is extensive, but not particularly flexible. There&#39;s a side mission of sorts with a pipe block, but it&#39;s only of fading interest.

Objectives of the level are rather loosely connected in the way they transition to each other. There&#39;s an assassination objective and a &quot;burn ash&quot; objective followed by enemy back-up. It&#39;s somewhat messy of a soup, where they can go off at differing times.

The level is ended by dropping off the building from right to the docks.

Title of the level is a pun that&#39;s related to the theme – not much to say there.

All in all, a decent map with some nifty gameplay that has a nice look to it.

Design keywords: [open-ended](#_Open-ended), vertical, [set piece](#_Set_Piece), [surreal architecture](#_Surreal_Architecture)

This is an open-ended level with a lot of verticality. The player is essentially descending into a pit. The level&#39;s look is directly inspired by cyber punk settings, and it can be quite overwhelming - making navigation itself a challenge where the player can literally lose themselves.

The main objective is to inspect all the ash caches, which is simple enough. This is where the complex and tightly packed layout comes in however, to add additional depth to the otherwise exceedingly simple task. However, hunting down the ash piles on the upper level that were missed when you&#39;ve mostly completed the level already can be a minor annoyance.

There&#39;s a thematically supporting subplot of sorts where few of the vampires will respawn if killed out of ash statues.

The two sides of the map provide alternative routes through the level though you can also just jump directly into the middle. Certain enemies are somewhat awkwardly situated at the center of the map where they aren&#39;t exactly sure how to proceed when becoming alerted. This is a place where minor, but manageable, issues of that map section&#39;s _surreal architecture_ can be noted.

There&#39;s a central bar at the bottom of the map acting as a set piece. While not exactly a central hub, it provides a centralized point of gameplay where it can be approached from almost any direction.

The level has a great feeling to it, and I think it manages to capture well the look it&#39;s going for. The aesthetics of the level are gorgeous if I may say so myself.

This is the quintessential level to showcase how well the motivational goal of phylactery hunt can carry a level on its own. It&#39;s an [_open-ended_](#_Open-Endedness) level that enables a mix of both aggressive and stealthy approaches.

The usage of lighting is still level is peculiar in the sense there are only few light sources (two main ones), but they are placed in a way that covers much of the map. This is enabled by this interesting openness these sections have when it comes to line of sight.

Layout has elements of surreal architecture certainly in it. A point of focus is the long cement walkways that cut the level into two on that central line, isolating the two and creating wide-level segmentation. The specific floors are interconnected well with themselves and the drop offs between the cement walls also act as connecting tissue for the two main floors.

One Bartender&#39;s phylactery is located inside the elevator shaft that is a novel, albeit possibly slightly annoying, conundrum for the player to resolve.

There&#39;s a hidden top crate section above that&#39;s reached with the elevator that provides some alternative gameplay - a stealth puzzle of sorts. The player is guided to go there by a line that is draw from the corresponding Bartender if it&#39;s killed while that bottle remains on that upmost floor.

One concern I have with the map is that the right-side of the map is quite heavily detached from the left side and getting there isn&#39;t necessarily neither easy nor lucrative.

There&#39;s a very fitting alchemy story that plays into the phylactery bottle mission.

## 8.17.Open-Heart

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1514383037](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1514383037)

Design keywords: [open-ended](#_Open-ended), [dynamic duo](#_Dynamic_duo_2), [weapon highlight](#_Weapon_highlight_1), [interconnected](#_Interconnected_1), Maiden, [Succubus](#_Succubus_/_Amber)

One of my favourite maps, this is a deceptively complex map with a seemingly simple premise and layout. There are no guns around to be picked up – only ones to be acquired are the burst rifles the Maidens are carrying. The assassination of those Maidens is also the main objective.

The level is an _open-ended_ sandbox-esque environment with many different routes available in, as well outside, the building. The _dynamic duo_ present here are the Maidens and Succubi that intertwines into story of the map. While the Succubi are extremely aggressive to close any distances, the Maidens counterbalance this by being the opposite – they like to attack from far away and are meticulous, perceptive, and careful.

There are couple of Grunts acting as hired guns that work as a disruptive force on this duo dynamic and give character to those couple of points in the map.

The long corridors with glass windows between them accentuate the precision and eyesight that the Maidens have, increasing the level&#39;s [_interconnectivity_](#_Segmented). Also, the way their rifles burst can give the player a chance to react to an incoming attack as the first burst might just break a glass wall/window instead of going through it.

Burst Rifle is a loud weapon and will easily alert the whole building. The Maidens are quick to pair up which can end up creating gatherings that are hard to deal with if left too long to their own devices.

Because of all these previous factors, the stage can also be considered a _weapon highlight_, both when used by the enemies and by the player.

The bottom floor of the map is quite dangerous and isn&#39;t necessarily the best place to start your attack from. This encourages the player to explore the middle and top floors of the map by landing on the various balconies on the sides of the building or going directly through the rooms inside. There is some venting present that is adequate but a bit more on the background as it were. This is once again place focus on navigating the building in the other forementioned ways.

The name of the level is a reference to the establishment it&#39;s taking place in, but also to the layout&#39;s look, form (it has these open valves akin to a heart) and lighting. The color red in itself is a strong visual motif here.

## 8.18.Dumping Down

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1768915328](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1768915328)

Design keywords: [open-ended](#_Open-Endedness), [interconnected](#_Interconnected_1), vertical, [surreal architecture](#_Surreal_Architecture)

This is a vertically focused, sandbox-esque, [_open-ended_](#_Open-Endedness)level. Its tightly packed layout makes it extremely [_interconnected_](#_Interconnected)which made the development process an arduous one. I had to scratch the initial design completely as it just didn&#39;t end up working as intended and bloated up being too large.

The interconnectivity here is what made the testing process so difficult as the sequences can&#39;t really be understood in isolation. At best, you could plan out larger swats of the level on their own and then eventually knit them together at the end. Unfortunately, moving rooms around is not possible in the editor, which will be one of the greatest limitations it has. This meant that a lot of incremental development had to be done for this map where enemy placements and opening in the layout were bit by bit tuned until they felt appropriate.

There&#39;s was a lot fiddling with the rooms here – removing walls whenever necessary for ease of travel and using glass walls to create lines of sight and openings to go through.

The drive for this level was thematical one, being inspired by concepts like landfill sites and the Blighttown and Valley of Defilement stages from the Souls series. It&#39;s a very cramped and confusing place with dangers lurking seemingly behind every nook and cranny.

The mission objective is simple: assassinate the three Bouncers at the bottom of the pit. This is to place emphasis on becoming accustomed to the navigation of the level and discourage attacking enemies indiscriminately.

There are many ways you can approach the layout. You can try to go about it as stealthily as possible – killing only the few blocking enemies in your path and distracting the rest. Alternatively, you can attempt to dig yourself down as fast as possible – leaving behind the enemies even as they see you.

Obviously, the method of killing most enemies is still present though it requires more tact than usually. I also discovered that certain rush strategies that aggressively enter certain sections to go face-to-face with the enemy assault there can be successful.

This all is in terms of the most basic, default &quot;revolver only&quot; load out. Special weaponry obviously can all enhance each of these various approaches respectively and make them more accessible. Especially suppressed 9mm seemed to provide a novel experience.

The level ends with a trek back up to Reaper&#39;s card at the beginning. This forces you to face the alerted enemies that you might have left behind carelessly. Again, because of this &quot;second objective&quot;, additional focus is placed for the player to come to understand the layout of the map.

There are couple of optional secrets present, that are intended to provide yet another alternative, hidden approach.

I think the title of the level is quite clear here. It reflects the setting while also referring to the way the player is forced dig down into the garbage – vertically, downwards the targets.

Enemies are all composed of zombies with few exceptions. Most of the enemies are fairly easy to dispatch on their own – the three Bouncers being the most formidable force in the stage in terms of sheer power and as a threat to the player. Contextually, this keeps the trio of Bouncers as the &quot;boss encounter&quot; even If they are merely counted as normal enemies. Another reason why the map is generally devoid of tough (bullet sponge) foes is that the intent is for the undead to overwhelm the player with numbers and the player&#39;s task is to play around that strategy.

Layout can be an intimidating one as there&#39;s a lot of different things going on very limited spaces. Realizing how far from your current location any shot from your guns will alert the enemies is especially notable here.

I can see this level exciting players who get into exploring the subtle intricacies of the level. On the other hand, it&#39;s also a level that can end frustrating player as at face-value the level can be overwhelming in the way it&#39;s packed together – indifferently entering combat can alert large sections of the map and get you swarmed with large crowds of enemies extremely quickly.

## 8.19.In Fine Paint

[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1768085527](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1768085527)

Design keywords: [weapon highlight](#_Weapon_highlight_1), [segmented](#_Segmented_1), [challenge run](#_Challenge_run_1), [Succubus](#_Succubus_/_Amber), [set piece](#_Platformer)

Defining factor here is this being a knife _weapon highlight_. It&#39;s a _segmented challenge run_ type of deal with two branching paths at the beginning. The player&#39;s direction is upwards, with these sweeping horizontal lines (floors) through-out. The singular objective is the assassination of Amber at the very end of the level.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this level is the way it ties its setting into the mechanics. This place is supposedly a gallery where blood splatter art is being made spontaneously. A big part of this level mechanically speaking are the dancers that are the main &quot;environmental hazard&quot; and force the player think carefully where they might want to start initiating attack sequences with their knives. Knife is probably the best weapon when it comes to making a mess on the walls and this is where the white wallpaper spots come in. They act hints for the player as to where it might be preferable to engage with the enemies and &quot;make their mark&quot; on these empty canvases.

There&#39;s a well-choreographed sequence right from the beginning where you can end up killing four Succubi back to back. Unfortunately, it really doesn&#39;t line up on first play given the initial cutscene that is shown at that time.

The spacious large white room is likely the most difficult part of the level to overcome. There a couple of approaches for it though I&#39;m specifically encouraging one where the player either rushes it through the door or the vent to the balcony with the knife since in my opinion it provides an intense and hectic gameplay experience that I find enjoyable. The section ends with an elevator, signifying the close end to the level and also giving a brief pause for the player to evaluate the floor above.

The upper-most floor is perhaps a bit anticlimactic if you realize that you can just throw your two knives at Amber, killing her nigh instantaneously, but given that the most challenging part is likely to be the large _set piece_ room before the elevator, I think it&#39;s reasonable to have a slightly more controlled situation to be the end of the level.

This I feel ended up working quite well despite my concerns. Deadbolt is clearly focused mainly on gunplay and any melee scenarios are secondary at best. So, creating a level exempt of most ranged combat is a risky approach.

Close distance kills waiting with hammers right next to stairways tend to be the end result of players abusing the artificial intelligence rather than desired gameplay. These can be a tedious fare, where the player is left waiting for the enemies to cough up the courage to enter the source of danger. This type of &quot;waiting in ambush&quot; seems like it would be hard to pull off to create an enjoyable gameplay experience.

This level it seems mostly lacks these scenarios, at least in the sense that they can be avoided, and the player is generally encouraged to strike relatively quickly. However, the large set piece room here in the middle of the stage can certainly lure the player into such as &quot;bait and switch&quot; kind of scenario if they don&#39;t feel comfortable enough to rush head-on into that room.

The biggest hurdles for player&#39;s enjoyment in this level probably are how well they can come into terms with pacing of the level and find the intended &quot;zones of engagement&quot; along with the timing

A very experimental map, this plays with the concept of partially hidden information, which is mainly supported by brown crates and randomization. The layout is small and condense.

An interesting factor here is that viability of various routes alters whenever the stage is reloaded (ie. when the Reaper dies). On the workshop page, I have an extensive explanation of how these routes represent themselves. The main mechanic to infer the location and type of enemies present in the current &quot;seed&quot; can be noted whether and how the illuminated objects are covered. On larger lighting objects – such as Bloody Mary sign – silhouettes of the enemies can be seen.

Randomization isn&#39;t limited to enemies, but also extends weapon drops and even certain decorations. The way it works here is that it&#39;s limited to binary operations where the inclusion of one enemy automatically negates another enemy for example. Level was balanced with this in mind so that the player should end up roughly similar amount of weaponry and challenge level – at least as far as the enemy count and the strength of individual enemies are concerned. Obviously, the high randomization can create scenarios which can be extremely tricky to resolve, but I would say it&#39;s part of the charm.

There are ways to implement randomization with more variation, but those require manual file editing, which will notable slow down the development process. It also seems that at least in this particular scenario, the less random-random is the better choice it still keeps some predictability which is a large part of the level – a puzzle of sorts.

The intended routes are somewhat stealthy in that they seek to enter unnoticed the deeper parts of the map and strike when you will get a weapon for your trouble. The main task is to find the weapons and gun dropping enemies and then start resolving the level in such as an order that you won&#39;t run out of ammunition. &quot;Rushes&quot; are eventually expected.

Brown crates have this unique property of hiding their contents until opened. This opening process itself provides a subtle little mechanic in itself in the scenarios where you are able space yourself out in such a manner that you can &quot;open&quot; a crate without exposing yourself to the potentially lurking enemies within.

The crates are connected with swinging doors on right sides. Given this, and how they are opened from the left side, this changes slightly how travelling from left to right and right to left function from each other.

I actually have an earlier protolevel where I first utilized randomization. There the task was akin to a &quot;hide and seek&quot;, but I felt it didn&#39;t end up being that engaging. It was a spacious level where the player would be asked to go through every nook and cranny to kill all the enemies that were skeletons in hiding. I might publish the map eventually.

Randomization seems like a tool with lots of potential regarding its utility. I&#39;m not entirely sure how expansive the design space this level presents is with the illuminated objects inside brown crates. This certainly seems like an area of design to revisit later on.

The level presents an alternative experience that I can see being divisive.

Made as an alternative version of [&quot;Open-Heart&quot;](#_Open-Heart), this is a stage [_derived_](#_Derivative) it with the main mechanical weights. Maidens and Succubi still act as the [_dynamic duo_](#_Dynamic_Duo) and the main weaponry available are the burst rifles that the Maidens drop.

There is, however, a big addition mechanically: enemy reinforcements. Each time a Maiden is killed, a Succubus back-up is sent from one corner of the map towards Reaper&#39;s location. This creates some chaos to an otherwise relatively controllable environment.

The level I feel is much less open compared to the &quot;Open-Heart&quot; and this is probably where it fails to live to the precedent set by it. The number of approaches is much more limited, with only three main directions. The setting is also more generic – having a more by-the-numbers club look to it.

Also, unlike in &quot;Open-Heart&quot;, the Maidens and their precision don&#39;t really get to shine here.

The level&#39;s title is mainly a reference to the additional enemy back-up element. If we really think about, it would heavily allude that the reinforcements themselves would be of the Demon faction and not Succubi.

In general, this feels a lot less inspired when we think of it in terms of its predecessor, which certainly can be a direct consequence of being a derivative work. It does switch some things up and has its own twist which is all good.

Design keywords: [conventional](#_Conventional,_traditional,_mundane), [segmented](#_Segmented_1)

The driving idea for this map was to mimic the more conventional type of layouts seen in the official campaign. The third house ended up having a peculiar architecture though.

This is a multipath stage with three buildings, each with a skeleton totem that the objective asks to be burned. Level of segmentation is somewhere in the middle where obviously the buildings are separated from each other and the different floors in a room are somewhat connected in that you might alert enemies from lower or higher floors.

Piping at the beginning provides an alternative path and also as a way to get back once the objective has been completed.

I think the level might have slightly sluggish feel to it. Partly this is because of the relatively high segmentation in an open-ended map that reduces interactivity, but also because of the way the player has to &quot;grab&quot; the totems, two of which are slightly off-course as far as navigation goes. The precise locations of weapon drops may also be a point of discussion to improve the level&#39;s flow.

As far as my workshop goes, the difficulty level is low here as it&#39;s intended be along the lines of the official campaign maps. The title of the stage is also calling back to the official campaign levels where it&#39;s somewhat recognizable common phrase but rather vapid contextually.

This isn&#39;t meant to be particularly deep, neither from design nor gameplay perspectives, so there isn&#39;t that much to comment. A big sticking point here might be the map&#39;s general lack of [_memorability_](#_Thematic_Notes,_Thematic)as there isn&#39;t anything particularly out of the ordinary going on. Then again, this is very much the original design pitch – to create something &quot;traditional.&quot;

## 8.37.Widows&#39; Tangle

Another quite experimental stage, this Is mainly intended to be a platformer-puzzle, which makes it rather unconventional. It&#39;s inspired by Sega Genesis era of games of that type.

This is a very heavily segmented map with numerous floating platforms around. The main task is to unlock the way above that you go through pipes. These platform &quot;islands&quot; each contain their own little challenge and either have, or lead to a pipe block hindering the player&#39;s progress.

Much emphasis on the layout is placed on navigation, such as dropping off to lower, otherwise non-accessible, sections of the map. It can and is partly meant to be a rather confusing experience as you&#39;re trying to mentally map the level _(a tangle)_. One optional secret is also in the level and it provides some trinkets but nothing particularly relevant.

There are some light puzzle elements with landmines. The two platforms on the left are alternative to each other – only one of them needs to be cleared. There are multiple ways to clear out the challenges present there – some of which require weaponry from other parts of the map.

A dynamic duo present in the stage is that of Shambler and Grunt. They complement each other in some interesting ways. A Shambler is always visible with its head while a Grunts can be hidden out of sight. This level&#39;s layout encourages entering close-range combat with Grunts as there are numerous swinging doors through which they can shoot. On the other hand, you generally want to stay away from Shamblers as they are very quick to close out distances and take you out with their SMGs once they notice you. While I think this is more of a side-note in this map, the dynamic here is great. I could see it being explored more fully in an open-ended layout.

Combat in the level is tightly packed in small spaces, with the said doors forcing the player&#39;s approach to the situations present.

The level ends with a relatively straight-forward boss battle of sorts that features two Madam Stelas, back to back. This by the way, is why the level&#39;s title has a plural possessive suffix.

Design wise, I think the main points of focus are how easily the player completes the challenges and how much they can enjoy the level. As is the case with anything puzzle oriented approach, this can be extremely hard to evaluate and might drastically change from person to person.

For the &quot;dropping off ledges&quot; sections, I placed Vampire hanging from the corners to hopefully help to make the player realize that there is some hopping expected from them. Lights have been used to indicate the location of balconies as well as the places to go to. For example, a bit part of the right-side of the map is the drop-off to the lower section. There is a grenade launcher there to grab player&#39;s attention, as well as snowy ground and the large motel sign.

In one playtest, an irritation came from the player not realizing that the early challenge on the left, dropping off from vent to another before you hit the land mine, is a thing you could execute successfully. This made the left-side kind of a mystery and made early travel there not possible. Fortunately, I had left in an alternative way to reach that section so the level could still be completed even when this platforming challenge was seen as impossible.

This seems like a thing that should be addressed. The good thing is that this on the early part of the map, so retries at this obstacle are the lowest cost ones, which should encourage players experimenting with the section a bit more than they would otherwise – hopefully &quot;cracking&quot; it before giving up too early. Once mastered, it&#39;s a surprisingly consistent. The level isn&#39;t particularly focused on this &quot;drop from vent to vent&quot; though, and hardly could be as it isn&#39;t a mechanically deep or complex task, so it isn&#39;t one that could really be pre-establishment earlier without wasting time and making the challenge itself moot in the process.

Certainly, an argument could be made to just remove it fully and it is certainly a consideration. However, you could very well argue for it – especially as it&#39;s technically an optional route. I don&#39;t know if this will ever have a fully satisfying solution. There&#39;s also the possibility that this is mostly a non-issue and that most players will overcome it without much of a hurdle. Hard to say.

## 8.38.Fashionably Late

I was a bit disappointed in the way other custom level designers had been using the mechanic of spawning in additional enemies with triggers, so I decided to create this level as a proof of concept. You could think of it as an extended tech demo to showcase how you can have enemies spawn in your level – without the frustrating element of the player not knowing when and where they are coming and then having those enemies be dropped right on top of them before they have proper amount of time to react.

This is a very tightly packed level where Reaper is placed at the center of a three-floor building. It works very much like a survival level though the main objective is to kill all enemies.

There&#39;s a lot of freedom as to where to go, with various types of weapons littered all over. Level is time-sensitive as the main _gimmick_ is akin to periodic enemy waves. Large number of ash vampire statues are set to light up in a specific sequence. Whenever an ash statue lights up, there&#39;s a two second delays before a vampire is spawned to fill its frame.

This gives player a strong sense when and where enemies are about to spawn. The sequence is always the same so they can start experimenting different routes with that in mind. The ash statues also remain faintly visible, specifically their glow, before they become highlighted, which also happens to give a general sense of how many are left as the level progresses.

Enemies are composed entirely of a very classic pair: Incubi and Succubi. Obviously, this is familiar to most through the official campaign where these are the most common vampire enemies. They are very much reflections of each other, as they have all the same states, similar height, and seemingly the same amount of health. The main difference is that one is a ranged enemy and other is a melee enemy. They do a fairly good job of mechanically supporting each other while thematically being a perfect pair.

Given that ash statues are limited to these two enemy types it&#39;s easy to see why this level exclusively features them. I do see the possibility of manually stretching the ash statues to for example fit the shorter enemies or even using the special editor asset of ghost for Grunts or such.

However, this level felt like it really didn&#39;t need any further complications. Incubi and Succubi being the most naturally attuned to being vertically placed is already pushing for them mechanically speaking. This is because just having enemies spawn on a limited vertical line _(roughly aiming around where their heads will be when they stand up)_ is a bit stale, but becomes doubly much more interesting when those enemies can reappear on the ceiling which forces the player to keep changing the alignment of their aim.

As per usual, a dynamic duo limited to two enemy types creates a much more consistently threat pacing and movement. Given the hectic nature of the stage where at later on it becomes harder to notice and keep track of all the incoming spawns, this is fairly important.

If we&#39;re being coy about it, there is a Punk and a Roland outside used as décor, but they despawned around the 30 second mark, which is roughly around when the last vampire enemy spawns in, so they don&#39;t play a role in the level functionally.

Regarding how it becomes harder to distinguish the spawns, I did consider having the ash statues despawn once their corresponding vampire died. Given the trigger hell the level already is, I&#39;m not keen on implementing it since despawns are one of the more unstable triggers you can add – especially when it&#39;s hard to keep them in order. I also think it might end up with somewhat messy visual display with ash statues going on and off.

A notable factor that would also be lost with despawning that players currently get, is a general feeling of how many are vampires are still left as all the non-highlighted statues are all upcoming reinforcements. Additionally, the current system works as a memory game where there&#39;s some uncertainty involved which isn&#39;t necessary bad. The main purpose here is that you know that a close by enemy spawn is incoming when a statue next to you lights up. So, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for you to be 100% certain about every spawn on the level when the action is at its high peak. The early part sets up the gimmick in such a manner, that you get the sense of how the level is going down.

Weapon pickups on this level were chosen to match few chosen criterias.

First off, I didn&#39;t want to have weapons with too much ammunition as I felt this would encourage more the approach of taking out the lights. While I think this is still a possibility, especially with the suppressed 9mm pistol, I think it has a reasonable time-cost associated with it. To me, it seemed like the most intense gameplay would emerge when the player is forced to either tackle the enemies in light or under the threat of a lights switch being turned on. This is why there are so many overlapping light sources in the map.

The second criteria is not to be a wall-piercing weapon as it would then be easy to use them to take out the lights from the other rooms from one above or below – very much dropping the penalty of letting those floors become crowded.

Explosive weaponry similarly would make it trivial to take crowds of enemies without having to face the consequences of wasting time.

The play area here is quite tiny and enemies become alerted easily from floors next to them. The weaponry allows players to play with this as there are weapons with wide range of loudness available.

A crossbow was added late in the development process as one of the later adjustments when I felt that the level needed further weaponry. There being no way for Reaper to enter the falling animation here makes it crash free. As a power silent weapon with limited ammunition, it seems like a perfect addition to the stage.

This level I can see being quite difficult for many as it requires you to keep moving around – turtling up is hardly viable as you will run out of ammunition fast that way. Spending time on a single room will lead to the other rooms being crowded and it&#39;s recommended to make fast sweeping attacks periodically on the other floors and grab the weaponry before the enemy count becomes difficult to handle. It&#39;s not unexpected that the player will have to do stairway jumping to take out enemies one by one.

While there is no time limit of any sort in the level, the way it easily becomes flooded with enemies forces the player to keep on the move and clearing them out, which is very smooth _time-sensitivity_ to have.

Difficulty is perhaps a sticking point here and I think it&#39;s worth discussion a bit further in this context. The waves of ash vampires end in roughly half a minute so it&#39;s a short experience. My stance is that the shorter the level, the quicker the player can jump back to the action, and the lesser the punishment is _(the amount of progress lost when the player fails)_, the more justification a level has to rank up its difficulty.

This level in my opinion has very high rating on all those scales, which makes it a perfect candidate for a &quot;hardcore&quot; experience. The shortness along with the challenge also accentuates the intensity of the stage. It has a mildly relaxed start but peaks out very fast. Another factor that alleviates the seemingly high difficulty is just how many different tactics the player is offered here, which seem roughly balanced with each other.

The enemy arrival points and times are telegraphed, there are various kind and numerous weaponry available, and the layout is conventional. All of the factors should play into making it a &quot;challenging yet fair&quot; gameplay experience.

This is a level that was mostly conceived out of the setting concept created by [Classic\_Cheese18](https://steamcommunity.com/id/classic_c18/). I had at numerous occasions previously thought about creating a weapon highlight map for scythe and this seemed like the perfect setting for it.

There was a lot of trouble with this level as I had originally.

Way back, when I still tried to get this done for the speedrunning level creation contest, I experimented with various open-ended levels with the scythe. In the end I realized they weren&#39;t working for the type of level I was thinking. One layout for example had a lot of vertical space, making it a bit annoying to aim with shooting stars and transition between the floors through stairways as the screen keeps shaking up and down. Also long sprawling in general seemed ill-fit for scythe as the weapon seems surprisingly resource taxing with how it turns enemies into rag dolls and sends them flying – this seems to add up with time.

Once I had finally conceptualized the current layout, I still had it as a single, long level instead of multi-staged one. I had issues with performance (frame rate / slowdown) and I felt it was an annoying repeat playing the same beginning levels with the already challenging enough middle and late parts. I also conceived a version that was made with very &quot;resource-light setting&quot; but considering the current setting was the main springboard for the whole level, it seemed to undermine the whole project.

Thankfully, I did recall that multi-staged level is an option (I use it so infrequently that it&#39;s in fact a thing) and that resolved all of the problems related to this. After some thinking regarding how the level was phased, I noted three great spots to have level transitions. The elevator was an obvious one. The first one was a bit trickier, the section starting with the dog and gaining access to the first throwing star seemed fitting. However, this left the start of the level rather short as originally the level started with the second building with flashlight.

This however worked to my advantage as I had felt that the start required perhaps a bit more &quot;regular play&quot; compared to the first succubi swarm one where you have to bait them out to the dark room downstairs. So with that I created the two conjoined three floor buildings, beginning with basic combat against Succubi and Incubi. The crux of the building is that you want to avoid the Cerberuses as while scythe is arguable the strongest weapon in the game, you can&#39;t still use it take a swarm of doggies out. Another thing I wanted to establish here where was also that the lack of ranged attacks with the scythe can make a relative regular enemy such as an Incubi a real threat if you can&#39;t reach it in time.

The second map of the stage then goes to introduce dogs and how tricky they can be to deal with the scythe – hence why shooting stars are introduced on this point. The buildings following the dog introduction are a bit more open-ended in terms of how you can go through them.

The last two buildings of the second part also include Maidens that have to be dealt with the shooting stars. When entering the last building, I added an elevation change so that you can&#39;t go back picking up whatever shooting stars you have might have left in addition to the one given to you at this point. The reasons for this are two-fold, I didn&#39;t want the player to clear the following four Maidens and then return for one or two shooting stars – this is even before I cut the level into parts as I found this type of resource management to be tedious and phase killing at this point. With the level transition this became crucial, as it was important for the player to spend those shooting stars on the Maidens. This is important because once a player enters a level transition, they only keep whatever weapon they have selected, which given you have shooting stars left, would make you lose your crucial scythe.

Another good thing that cutting the level into these segments is that I now could make each of the level&#39;s vertical height exactly that of a single screen. This now avoided the &quot;screen-shakiness&quot; with the final maiden challenge of this second part. It also made it easier to set-up the final stage&#39;s &quot;ambush&quot; with Succubi falling out of the sky. I recall in very early drafts of this map, this &quot;ambush&quot; section came right before the second stage&#39;s final Maiden building rather than after the elevator. Considering how you need to hide the Succubi off-screen, having it be placed here was somewhat sketchy.

Also, there is some &quot;jank&quot; on this &quot;ambush&quot; section (difficult to react immediately), and it&#39;s likely going to take couple of tries to get down properly by the player, so its location here wasn&#39;t ideal. This is yet another factor where cutting the level into parts helps considerably as the &quot;jankiness&quot; is immensely alleviated by having it appear as the first part of a singular new stage. Frustration is cut almost completely as you can retry the segment immediately instead of having to replay other sections to have a new go.

In the third and final map of this level I finally introduce Sergeants. The good thing here is that it&#39;s now perfectly fine that they drop sledgehammers for players to pick-up (a melee weapon comparable to the scythe) as the level is close to an end and they can&#39;t create problematic situations for themselves once doing so now. For some players, picking up the sledgehammer might be even preferable.

The initial &quot;scythe selection screen&quot; I had already planned from the get-go though I dropped it midway through development and then included again once I cut the level into parts. The intended effect is to highlight to the player that the scythe is your main weapon here. Mechanically it also makes it unnecessary for the player to re-pickup the scythe whenever they boot up the first section after dying as they now have the weapon auto-equipped. While technically the selection screen is the &quot;first part&quot; I would refer it to as the pre-level as there is barely any gameplay or such in there.

To me, the main strengths of this level are phasing and evocative setting.

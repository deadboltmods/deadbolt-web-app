- [DEADBOLT Q&A](https://hopoo.tumblr.com/post/171900977909/deadbolt-qa)

fave:
> Q: Just wanted to say, you guys are my favorite games studio, hands down. Now for the question: Now that the Reaper has completed his task and is allowed to rest, what’s next? Is the Fireplace going to keep him resting for a while? Does our MC have another task to accomplish?
> A: The Fireplace has never let a reaper “rest” before - the reason he is allowed to rest is because Ibzan never got to, and the Fireplace is trying something different with you. This is unexplored territory for the both of them – presumably he just pets his cat and gets bored before getting back to work.

Happy Birthday, DEADBOLT!

The Place’s theme

> Q: This probably a bit late, but in DEADBOLT, why do the undead resist getting killed by Reapers? Isn't it a first class ticket to the afterlife, and presumably warmth?
> A: ————————-DEDBORT SPOILERS————————
>
> Yes! The entirety of the Place’s theme is that of irony - which is hellish in its own way.
>
> The obvious ones are the undead themselves - zombies are from drug overdoses, yet they are obsessed with ash. Vampires were betrayed by a lover in their previous life, yet are the most lustful and are always looking for > new partners. Skeletons killed themselves, yet seek the warmth (life) that they used to have. There are also smaller interactions as well that highlight that irony. Timur can only be killed by his own traps, and Madam > Stela is doing all of this so she can see the sun again, which would (if she behaves like a classic vampire) lead to her death. Skeletons are the only ones who can be revived, yet they’re the ones that wanted to be dead > in the first place.
>
> Most important of all is the story of Ibzan and the fireplace - despite being the god of life, the fireplace failed to give Ibzan something to live for, resulting in his suicide and the catalyst for all the events in DEADBOLT. This is also why the fireplace showers you with awkward gifts - he doesn’t actually know what makes life worth living, but he’s trying his best to not lose you as well.

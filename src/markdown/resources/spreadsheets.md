## Game

### [Weapon Stats (Basic)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wRHEnOm6cgiTXDrFpB7XtwV2mY4qHr5wfQAnqzRaje4/edit#gid=482879943)

Detailed weapon stats, including damage and sound. Easy to read as it has no complex data.

### [Game Master Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qRyF3laHK2bKYyI552aA5PElzib8ak1FfLNxDId9Lzg/edit#gid=482879943)

Holds most of the data from the game, from enemy health to mission par times. It also has an STK (shots to kill) tab, which shows how many shots it takes to kill enemies.

## Editor

### [Editor Master Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XsQPEOL5d5vsu0OXlZaMR01yTMRrRebbrrtjea6FaHU/edit#gid=0)

Details for the Editor sheet. The first sheet is used to generate the editor’s object list, using [this](https://bitbucket.org/codemuffin/deadbolt-editor-generate-grid/src/master/) node.js script. Items with 2+ in the “Since” column are available in the modded editor. Items in red have issues; they are supported in the editor but are hidden by default, and you can enable them in the INI.

### [Missing Editor Objects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WMEQVOAUkEOYdwWXUaW-3tJF_bACcXXWaPGs6ahJ5Dg/edit#gid=1323692466)

List of objects that were missing from the vanilla level editor, before they were added to the modded editor. There’s a lot of great information here for level creators. The content was a collaborative effort, I believe Tahazzar wrote the majority of it.

		"question": "<p>As a proud member of the Southern Hemisphere of this wonderful globe of ours, I was just wondering what the 'Summer', 'Fall', etc in the roadmap are referring to. Is Summer the Northern Hemisphere Summer? In addition, are there any more concrete dates for the Skills 2.0 update now that the first update is out, and more importantly, what sort of feedback are you looking for from the community until then?</p>",
		"answer": "<p>Yes, sorry this is Northern hemisphere summer. Next update is coming in September.<br/><br/>In terms of feedback, QOL is typically the most actionable one. We do listen for overall community ~feeling~ on things like balance, but QOL is stuff we would individiually address</p>",

		"question": "<p>Stop saying soon give us real updates and don't say stay tuned to our social media then not use said social media for two days. Why can't you just say that \"QA found some bugs and we are working on them\" why do have go soonTM soonR say tuned soooooonnnn and then nothing. I know you dont even read these but what else can we do you don't responded to anything </p>",
		"answer": "<p>Fair question - first, I’ll assume that this response is presumably coming from a place of excitement.<br/><br/>The reason we say “Soon” is because <i>we actually don’t know when outside of it being actually soon -</i> when we went to E3, we were hoping to have it approved by QA by then, but it actually wasn’t because the build was a bit bigger than expected.<br/><br/>We don’t want to set dates and then have to push them back, so we opt to not have dates at all until its 100% ready. It’s not to be super cool and hype it up - <i>however</i>, it’s possible that maybe we’re being a bit TOO cautious on that front. <br/><br/>Please keep letting us know how you feel, its really important! We’ve never really had a live game before, so this is something we’re learning to do as well.</p>",

		"question": "This is kind of a question/feedback, but I was wondering if the future characters are planned to be designed with more team-play in mind? I find that the multiplayer in ror1 felt kind of the same as playing by yourself because there were very few characters with support skills (acrid speed buff being the exception, and enforcer technically aside from being so bad that you couldn't really play him), and ror2 seems like a good opportunity to remedy that. New engineer is a good start, but only 1/6.",

		"answer": "<p>I wouldn’t say low-poly, but more like mid-poly. It’s ~5k a character, and most enemy models use a baked normal map as well.<br/><br/>We actually use a modified version of the deferred pipeline (so we can use a lot of point lights on projectiles, effects, etc.) We use one of our gbuffer channels as a reference to a ramp to remap our NdotL values to - so most character’s use a two-tone ramp, but the environment uses a very soft ramp. You can also use a ramp that doesn’t end in black for a fake subsurface effect. The effect is a bit subtle, but it adds a lot in terms of making characters contrast more. Below is an example of the character ramp (center) compared to 2 environment ramps (side).

Is PvP just off the menu?",
		"answer": "<p>Generally speaking, in networking a portion of the control is given to the client (your local version of the game) and the rest is given to the server (the over-the-internet master version of the game.) Making things client authoritative makes it feel more responsive and correct for the local player, but making things server authoritative makes it fairer and less susceptible to cheating. Since this is a PvE game, that means that we can give the client a bunch more authority (and therefore a much smoother experience) since the monsters won’t complain about lag compensation, getting shot around walls, etc. However, that means that if there WAS PvP, it would simply be unfair because the server trusts the client too much to report hits, among other things. <br/></p><p>So yeah, it could “functionally” support PvP, but it would be no fun even for screwing around. Also none of the items nor abilities given to the player-controlled characters are intended to be fair on the receiving end. It would just be not fun.<br/></p>",

Timur the Tinkerer’s icon was actually a repurposed icon from the first reaper you’d fight against, who committed suicide via shotgun (hence the missing chunks, jaw, and the bullet holes in the back of the head.) <br/></p><p>Yeah.<br/></p>",

I personally am more proud of DEADBOLT, but they are both completely different games (and more importantly, were made with two different intents!)<br/><br/>Risk of Rain was made with an audience in mind (roguelike players), which is much better from a business perspective.<br/><br/>DEADBOLT was made with an experience in mind (feelin badass), which is better from an&hellip; artistic perspective? Maybe? But no amount of marketing can create an audience that doesn’t exist.<br/></p>",

For example: player 1 opens a chest and gets something, but it doesn’t open for anyone else, so players 2, 3, and 4 can open the same chest and get themselves items.

		"answer": "<p>That would totally fix that issue, but would go against one of my own personal design rules when making online games.<br/><br/>I personally think that a lot of multiplayer games nowadays reaaally suffer from “instancing” or local events. I think that a lot of the fun of multiplayer online games is experiencing stuff together in the same world, and instancing segments the game into a&hellip; semi-shared world. You’re not playing the same game, its like you all hit Start at the same time on a single player match. I want to avoid any local instancing as much as possible so you can share moments like when a friend gets a very rare item drop.<br/></p>",

From what you showed of the video and gif this latest update, you are 8 minutes in and with only 8 enemies and no onscreen bullets. That's not Monsoon difficulty is it?",
		"answer": "<p>That is definitely the intent!  We’re planning on doing a pass on the director and overall balance very soon. It’s a nice feeling that that’s something we can now focus on, because it means development is going well enough that we can start thinking about game balance. Enemies also have a much bigger sphere of influence in RoR2 - most enemies were melee range in RoR1, with affixes and spiders being the biggest source of projectiles. In contrast, most enemies in RoR2 currently have projectiles. We also have to make sure that every projectile can’t be dodged by circle strafing. <br/></p><p>We always appreciate this sort of feedback, by the way.

I'm aware of the limitations with screen space, but local multiplayer is a dying scene and a market easily tapped imo. Thanks for all the hard work!",
		"answer": "<p>Yep, we currently have split screen working, the only hurdle I can think of atm is performance if we ever port to a console later down the line. <br/><br/>As for support classes&hellip; we really don’t want playing RoR2 in single player to be a shadow of playing it in multiplayer, if that makes sense. We have some items that have area of effect buffs (like the Warbanner) that help better in cooperative scenarios. A new effect we’re also testing on the Engineer to replace his harpoons is a shield that you can transfer to a nearby ally - since you always have an ally in single player (your turret), it doesn’t feel bad to see that ability<br/></p>",

		"question": "This probably a bit late, but in DEADBOLT, why do the undead resist getting killed by Reapers? Isn't it a first class ticket to the afterlife, and presumably warmth?",
		"answer": "<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-DEDBORT SPOILERS&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/></p><p>Yes! The entirety of the Place’s theme is that of irony - which is hellish in its own way.<br/><br/>The obvious ones are the undead themselves - zombies are from drug overdoses, yet they are obsessed with ash. Vampires were betrayed by a lover in their previous life, yet are the most lustful and are always looking for new partners. Skeletons killed themselves, yet seek the warmth (life) that they used to have. There are also smaller interactions as well that highlight that irony. Timur can only be killed by his own traps, and Madam Stela is doing all of this so she can see the sun again, which would (if she behaves like a classic vampire) lead to her death. Skeletons are the only ones who can be revived, yet they’re the ones that wanted to be dead in the first place.<br/><br/>Most important of all is the story of Ibzan and the fireplace - despite being the god of life, the fireplace failed to give Ibzan something to live <i>for, </i>resulting in his suicide and the catalyst for all the events in DEADBOLT. This is also why the fireplace showers you with awkward gifts - he doesn’t actually know what makes life worth living, but he’s trying his best to not lose you as well.<br/></p>",

But gamedev has always been a hobby, and we just want to <i>try</i> 3D because of the potential it has, and we think we could make a fun game.<br/><br/>3D has a couple big pro and cons from 2D, but the biggest factor is that graphics is extremely technical in 3D - it requires a lot of shader and lighting work. This is also a blessing in disguise, because you can improve the entire look of your game in an hour after shader tweaks or post processes.<br/></p>",

The checks also stop rolling once there&rsquo;s success, and you probably won&rsquo;t get so many unless you&rsquo;re playing on Command where stuff is gonna get kinda goofy to begin with. We&rsquo;re also currently using Unity&rsquo;s built-in RNG, but because we will want multiple RNG instances and serializable RNG states we&rsquo;re looking to replace it; we haven&rsquo;t done much looking yet but xoroshiro128plus is a very appealing option which we&rsquo;re hoping will yield good performance benefits. <br/><br/>-ghor<br/></p>",

If we showed a 30 minute clip right now, I feel like we’d be saying “Oh, but thats placeholder” or “oh thats an old thing” or “yeah thats not done yet” to 99% of the feedback we get, which then sounds like we’re making a bunch of excuses, if that makes sense?

		"question": "Hey Hopoo Team, big fan of the first RoR and DEADBOLT, found out about this DevBlog by chance and naturally binged through all the Updates. I am super excited. As I looked at all the little sneak peeks I was wondering about the cameraposition of the player. As seen in most Screenshots, the perspective is 'Above-the-Head', will it be possible to change that to a more 'Over-The-Shoulder' kind of view as an option?",
		"answer": "<p>Hi!<br/><br/>Been gettin’ that a lot - on a technical level, the camera position is simply a vector3 and can be easily adjusted.<br/><br/>On a <i>design </i>standpoint, a game’s entire gameplay is really based around its camera position. We’ve gotten a lot of requests for over-the-shoulder.<br/><br/>Our logic for doing directly behind is:<br/>-The camera has to be zoomed out enough to see your feet for platforming sections. Most 3D platformers have their camera centered or in fixed position to help aid jumps</p><p>-Risk of Rain has a lot of spherical/orbital auras around your player. It’s important you can see the edge of the sphere, and if it’s offset, it can be disorienting and also the radius has to be smaller equal to the offset so it still remains in the camera frame<br/><br/>-You get swarmed a lot, and a bias to one side can make certain directions of attack deadlier than others</p><p>- Obscuring the attack path from the player to the cursor is usually not too big of an issue because of the scale of the enemies. </p><p><br/>However&hellip; this is obviously our first 3D game, so our logic could to be totally wrong. Tell us if this makes sense - we try over the shoulder semi frequently, but the things above always cause us issues. <br/></p>",

The reason it performs so well with a million bloodstains is that it just draws on top of the surface without ever wiping it, so it just draws 1 surface regardless of the number of blood splatters. I use the same technique for bullet oles in doors. This does add a unique challenge to the animation of it though, since the last frame will look like every frame super-imposed on top of each other, so theres a limit in what I can animate.<br/><br/><br/></p>",

		"question": "Hey! Really dig your fireplace particle effect, tried to recreate it in HTML Canvas to understand it better.  I'm using a horizontal line emitter that moves left & right semi-randomly, and constant velocity particles.  Couple of things I couldn't figure out: what the sprites should look like, particle rotation (?), and how to get the turbulent appearance (particles in mine look very predictable).  Would you mind taking a look? Can't post a link here, but it's newest repo on my GitHub, same name",
		"answer": "<p>1. I use a spring-mass-damper to move the line emitter back and forth, makes it look a little smoother<br/></p><p>2. The particles come out in a 0-180 degree direction, with a gravity force upwards so it rotates towards that eventually; maybe that&rsquo;s the turbulence you&rsquo;re talking about?<br/><br/>3. The particles rotate very slowly and come out at a random angle. They also shrink over time, rather than alpha fade away. I use 3 sets of particles at different depths + size + color to add volume<br/><br/>4. They choose from a random subimage on creation from list <br/></p><figure><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/87ee07375cc8a4524f10c3f8b635e5bf/tumblr_inline_nkfxfsA8pL1rcwq50.png\"/></figure><p>5. The particles have a chance of spawning a spark particle during its lifetime; the spark particle has a wide variance on direction, so it&rsquo;ll kinda jitter around. It also flickers on/off. Nice thing about this is that the number of sparks scale with the life of the flame particles, so I can scale the particle life up/down to adjust flame height for different situations</p><p>6. The base of the flame spawns a few flames randomly to make it look fatter and less like a candlelight<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/></p>",

At the moment I&rsquo;ve put my degree as a backup and plan on focusing on making more games post-graduation. <br/><br/>I want to make bigger games, but I simultaneously scare myself by thinking of a bigger game than RoR (in terms of development time, bugs, etc.) Not sure what that means for me. </p>",

The reason it doesn&rsquo;t raise the cap to 1400 (and the damage bonus with it) is because I felt that would be too snowball-y (more damage, more gold, more damage). Might be wrong though!</p>",
